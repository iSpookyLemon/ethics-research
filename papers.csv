Our work focuses on the needs, practices, risks, and challenges of activists during this revolution, with larger inferences to future movements and technologies. Our insights stem from in-depth interviews with 13 Sudanese activists. The study received IRB approval from our institutions, and we took extra precautions given the sensitivity of this topic, as detailed in Section IV.\n"", ""Participant safety and ethics. Our study was approved by our institutions' Human Subjects Departments (IRB). Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of the topic, we took precautions to minimize the risk to participants. Most importantly, we let participants' own comfort level define their experience by giving them choices, including the technology we used to contact them and the amount of information they shared with us before and during the interview. All participants agreed to be recorded. Most participants preferred audio-only calls over video; in the interest of building trust, we kept our video on even if they did not. We also only collected enough information from participants to contact them on the day of the interview and did not pay participants, as our institutions required collection of name and address in order to dispense any payment, and international sanctions also prevented us from paying participants who were physically in Sudan.\n"", 'Looking beyond our specific procedures, a separate ethical question emerges about whether the publication of our results will ultimately help or harm the efforts of future activists. For example, will the findings in this report allow future governments to prepare for--and thus stifle--future activists? Our findings suggest that it is unreasonable to expect that all future activists will be technically sophisticated. However, it is reasonable to expect that nation states will have technical sophistication. Thus, we believe that while the findings in this paper can contribute to the creation of technologies to empower future activists, we do not believe that our findings go beyond what a sophisticated nation state could deduce.

Doing good by fighting fraud Ethical anti fraud systems for mobile payments,2021,IEEE S&P,True,True,Mobile Security,exempt,"['Doing good by fighting fraud: Ethical anti-fraud systems for mobile payments\n', 'Abstract--App builders commonly use security challenges, a form of step-up authentication, to add security to their apps. However, the ethical implications of this type of architecture has not been studied previously.\n', 'Challenges have the potential to skirt the difficult ethical issues that apps face with security decisions in their apps. In a typical app, the app will have an algorithm that predicts whether a user or a transaction is suspicious. These algorithms could potentially rely on features that unfairly influence its decision, such as a zip code. To reduce the impact of mistakes by their algorithms, apps can use user-centric security measures in lieu of suspending users or blocking transactions. This technique allows users that the algorithm blocks incorrectly to verify themselves or their payment methods automatically.\n', 'Unfortunately, challenges open a new set of ethical conundrums. Apps that want to respect end-user privacy and run their challenges via compute intensive machine learning models on the device will have to cope with the 1-4 orders of magnitude difference in capabilities on the devices that they will see in practice (Section III). Apps that opt for predictable ML performance by streaming data to a server and running their ML there will have to deal with a 1000x difference in bandwidth between 3G and 5G networks [52], and the people who use it may have to pay for that bandwidth directly. Security challenges must deal with these subtleties of practical deployments or else they will block users unethically.\n', ""The most dangerous aspect of the ethical implications inherent with security challenges is that they solve an app's business problem but have the potential to still make compromises on users of a low socioeconomic status. One example of this tradeoff is with Lime's Access program [28]. Lime allows users from low-income households to get reduced rates with Lime rentals by proving that they qualify for the program by scanning welfare documents or utility bills. These documents contain personal information that typical Lime users do not have to provide, and Lime does not process these documents themselves, they use a third party for this service [27]. Just to be clear, we, as proponents of this program applaud Lime for implementing it, but Lime forces users to give up privacy to qualify. It would be better if they could prove that these documents are genuine without needing to send sensitive information to a third-party server.\n"", ""Our position is that ethical security challenges should run client side, support complex machine learning (if needed), and run effectively on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Daredevil, a system for running complex clientside ML models for security on the full range of devices one is likely to see in practice today. Daredevil's design includes decomposing machine learning tasks for redundancy and efficiency, streamlining individual tasks for improved performance, and exploiting task and data parallelism.\n"", ""· We present the first large-scale in-field study of on-device deep learning for security. Our measurements focus on Boxer, a system for scanning credit cards, where we demonstrate that due to the degree of hardware diversity, deep-learning-based security challenges have the potential of being unethical despite solving the apps' business problem.\n"", ""Our university's IRB board reviewed our study and ruled it to be exempt from IRB.\n"", 'Boxer solves the business problem that its designers intended to solve, since it runs OCR successfully on 84.7% of the devices overall. However, the success rate on devices that run at a rate of less than 1 FPS is mere 31.87%, and these devices make up 44.61% of the Android devices we measure, introducing a potential ethical conundrum by blocking users solely because they have an inexpensive device.\n', 'In this paper, we introduce Daredevil, a new system that we design and implement to realize ethical deep learning powered user-centric security challenges, with the goal of providing equal access to all users.

Our model is the first that supports a fine-grained analysis of all relevant security guarantees that EMV is intended to offer. We use our model to automatically identify flaws that lead to two critical attacks: one that defrauds the cardholder and a second that defrauds the merchant. First, criminals can use a victim's Visa contactless card to make payments for amounts that require cardholder verification, without knowledge of the card's PIN. We built a proof-of-concept Android application and successfully demonstrated this attack on real-world payment terminals. Second, criminals can trick the terminal into accepting an unauthentic offline transaction, which the issuing bank should later decline, after the criminal has walked away with the goods. This attack is possible for implementations following the standard, although we did not test it on actual terminals for ethical reasons. Finally, we propose and verify improvements to the standard that prevent these attacks, as well as any other attacks that violate the considered security properties. The proposed improvements can be easily implemented in the terminals and do not affect the cards in circulation.\n"", 'Our symbolic analysis using Tamarin also reveals that, in an offline contactless transaction with a Visa or an old Mastercard card, the card does not authenticate to the terminal the Application Cryptogram (AC), which is a card-produced cryptographic proof of the transaction that the terminal cannot verify (only the card issuer can). This enables criminals to trick the terminal into accepting an unauthentic offline transaction. When the acquirer later submits the transaction data as part of the clearing record, the issuing bank will detect the wrong cryptogram, but the criminal is already long gone with the goods. We did not test this attack on actual terminals for ethical reasons as this would defraud the merchant.\n', 'Ethical Considerations We carried out all our tests using our own credit and debit\n', 'This constitutes a ""free lunch"" attack in that the criminal can purchase low-value goods or services without actually being charged at all.

The next step is to predict keystrokes from the extracted inter-packet times. Song et al. [47] pioneered the recovery of keystrokes from interactive SSH sessions. In their work, they showed the feasibility of such an attack when capturing SSH packets on a network tap. For this purpose, they used bigrams and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to guess typed passwords. The challenge with password datasets is that it is unethical to collect real passwords from users. This would leave the option to let users type a predetermined set of passwords. However, real passwords typing underlies a unique typing frequency which is hard to approximate when users are not trained to type these passwords frequently and over a longer time period. Furthermore, such a dataset would need hundreds of different passwords for a fair evaluation. Similar to more recent work in the area [23, 48], we decided to use word guessing to show an attacker can successfully perform keystroke prediction from the cache measurements.\n']","['Servers', 'Timing', 'Microarchitecture', 'Security', 'Random access memory', 'Prefetching']","['cache storage', 'circuit optimisation', 'DRAM chips', 'network servers', 'reverse engineering']","['practical cache attacks', 'peripheral performance', 'memory subsystem', 'DRAM throughput', 'modern network card', 'peripheral data', 'modern Intel processors', 'last level cache', 'Direct Cache Access', 'DCA', 'Direct Memory Access', 'sensible performance optimization', 'security analysis', 'NetCAT', 'network-based PRIME+PROBE cache attack', 'network client', 'general adversarial settings', 'keystroke timing attack', 'data-direct I/O', 'remote machine', 'covert channel', 'sandboxed server process', 'network timing-based sensitive information', 'victim SSH connection', 'microarchitectural components']",[],https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152768

Meddling Middlemen Empirical Analysis of the Risks of Data Saving Mobile Browsers,2020,IEEE S&P,True,True,Web Privacy,none,"[""Ethical considerations. From an ethical perspective, both types of scans merely gather information and do not attempt to exploit any service in any way; this is in line with widely used prior work, e.g., the ZMap and Censys Internet-wide scans [31], [33]. We opt to collect our own data (instead of relying on third-party services like Censys) as we need to ensure that the host being scanned is the host involved in proxying the DSB's connections. The practices of IP churn and reuse (e.g., in public clouds) suggest that we cannot rely on historical data as published by prior works. We are confident that our fingerprinting approach did not adversely affect the proxy's performance or their users.\n"", 'As multiple users share the same DSB proxy, the reputation for a proxy depends on the aggregated behavior of all its users. Hence, it is possible that malicious users could negatively impact the web browsing experience of the benign majority. To evaluate this scenario, we conducted a proof-of-concept attack against Puffin. Using one device which we designated as the ""attacker"", we performed minor bot-like activity on a web site protected by a popular anti-bot service: after requesting the site\'s home page multiple times in a short time window, the attacker was shown a captcha. When visiting the same site through Puffin on the ""victim"" device (same smartphone model), it would immediately receive a captcha lasting for a short time frame (approximately 5 minutes). We empirically determined that this effect is only present if the victim and attacker (i) share the same proxy IP address, (ii) have the same device model, and (iii) visit the same web site in close temporal proximity. We determined the probability of a user meeting these criteria during our testing period is small enough to ensure no users were effected by our experiment. However, in the unlikely event that these criteria were met, the resulting effect would be a limited inconvenience to any users of the web site, who would only need to solve a captcha to continue browsing. While in practice attackers could trivially increase the volume of requests and significantly magnify the impact of the attack (e.g., using multiple popular devices), we did not attempt/explore this for ethical reasons.\n']","['Browsers', 'Security', 'Web servers', 'Ecosystems', 'Google', 'Privacy']","['Android (operating system)', 'cryptography', 'data privacy', 'Internet', 'mobile computing', 'online front-ends', 'risk analysis']","['mobile data plan constraints', 'data-saving features', 'privacy threat', 'risk analysis', 'data-saving mobile browser', 'Web pages', 'streaming media on-the-go', 'security threat', 'data-saving functionality', 'Android data-saving browser ecosystem', 'DSB ecosystem', 'protocol-level behavior', 'user security posture', 'proxy servers', 'man-in-the-middle attacks', 'weakened TLS cipher suite selection', 'security headers', 'HSTS', 'encrypted Web', 'security trade-off', 'empirical risk analysis']",[],https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152644

An Analysis of Pre installed Android Software,2020,IEEE S&P,True,True,Android and iOS,approved,"[""Obtaining pre-installed apps and other software artifacts (e.g., certificates installed in the system root store) at scale is challenging. As purchasing all the mobile handset models (and their many variations) available in the market is unfeasible, we decided to crowdsource the collection of pre-installed software using a purpose-built app: Firmware Scanner [34]. Using Firmware Scanner, we obtained pre-installed software from 1,742 device models. We also decided to use Lumen, an app that aims to promote mobile transparency and enable user control over their mobile traffic [86], [49] to obtain anonymized network flow metadata from Lumen's real users. This allows us to correlate the information we extract from static analysis, for a subset of mobile apps, with realistic network traffic generated by mobile users in the wild and captured in user-space. In the remainder of this section, we explain the methods implemented by each app and present our datasets. We discuss the ethical implications of our data collection in Section II-C.\n"", 'C.

For example, at least 30,000 HTTP conversations with session tokens were identified and may be vulnerable in HTTP hijacking attacks. Similarly, DNS responses are regularly observed over the VSAT feed, while predicting DNS queries may be difficult (as these are sent over the uplink and thus not observed in signal captures), certain operating systems (such as older versions of Windows) generate predictable DNS transaction IDs and could accept a malicious response [32].

Why Does Your Data Leak Uncovering the Data Leakage in Cloud from Mobile Apps,2019,IEEE S&P,True,True,Web and Cloud Security,none,"['Zero-data-leakage Vulnerability Verification. After we have retrieved the values of the keys used by the cloud APIs, next we have to infer the types of the keys. For some cloud services (e.g., Azure Storage), app keys and root keys are in different formats (as shown in Table II), and we can easily tell whether a key of our interest is a root key. However, for some other cloud services (e.g., AWS), app keys and root keys have the same format. To deal with this problem, a straightforward approach is to send a request to the server by using the key to access some root user exclusive data. If we are able to retrieve these data, then it implies there is a data leakage vulnerability. However, such an approach would violate the ethics of accessing private-sensitive data.\n', 'VII. DISCUSSION Our study has uncovered tens of thousands of mobile apps that contain cloud data leakage vulnerabilities. Altogether, these apps have accumulated downloads of between 4 billion and 14 billion. As such, it is a very serious security problem. In this section, we discuss further why such vulnerabilities exist and the countermeasures (§VII-A), the limitations and future work (§VII-B), and finally how we handled ethics during our study (§VII-C).\n', 'Third, due to ethics considerations (§VII-C), we only validated the data leakage vulnerabilities with our best efforts.

In fact, this is because we could only automatically register users with only 13, 506 out of the 101, 380 apps that used Firebase in our dataset. We should be able to identify more vulnerabilities if there are any other approaches to bypass the authentication for the remaining 87, 874 apps, or if there is collaboration from the cloud\n', 'C. Ethics Since our work aims to identify data leakage vulnerabilities\n', 'in the cloud, we had to ensure that our research would not directly leak any of the customer data. As described in §V-C, we took the ethics into consideration and designed a zero-dataleakage vulnerability identification approach by considering how the server would respond to a client request based on different user roles.

RIDL Rogue In Flight Data Load,2019,IEEE S&P,True,False,Hardware Security,none,"['To protect against control speculation attacks, vendors have released mitigations that prevent the hardware from executing (speculatively) unsafe code paths. For instance, Intel released a microcode update with three new capabilities: IRBS, STIBP and IBPB to prevent indirect branch poisoning instructions and to protect against BTI attacks [76]. Another suggested mitigation uses the lfence instruction to restrict control speculation. This can be applied as a compiler-based defense, mitigating multiple families of attacks. 1 To protect against BCB attacks, the compiler inserts an lfence instruction after conditional branches to stop the BPU from speculating on the code path taken. 2 To protect against BTI attacks, the lfence instruction is introduced as part of the Retpoline [6] mitigation. Researchers have also suggested extending Retpoline to guard ret instructions and prevent RSB attacks [71]. The Retpoline mitigation converts each indirect jump into a direct call to a stub function, that returns to the destination of the initial indirect branch. This is achieved by altering the stack, replacing the return address of the function. Since return instructions also trigger speculation, an lfence loop is inserted at the expected return site of the stub, to inhibit further code execution. Retpoline can also perform RSB filling [77].

Characterizing Pixel Tracking through the Lens of Disposable Email Services,2019,IEEE S&P,True,True,Privacy,exempt,"['Understanding Disposable Email Services. In this paper, we collect data from 7 popular disposable email services from October 16, 2017 to January 16, 2018 over three months. By monitoring 56,589 temporary email addresses under popular usernames, we collect in total 2,332,544 incoming email messages sent from 210,373 online services and organizations. We are well aware of the sensitivity of email data. In addition to working with IRB, we also take active steps to ensure research ethics such as detecting and removing PII from the email content and removing personal emails. Our analysis reveals key findings about the usage of disposable email services.\n', 'To understand how disposable email services are used, we collect emails that are sent to disposable addresses. First, we describe our data collection process. We then present a preliminary analysis of the dataset. Finally, we discuss the active steps we take to ensure research ethics.\n', 'Biases of the Dataset. This dataset provides a rare opportunity to study disposable email services and email tracking. However, given the data collection method, the dataset inevitably suffers from biases. We want to clarify these biases upfront to provide a more accurate interpretation of the analysis results later. First, our dataset only covers the userspecified addresses but not the randomly-assigned addresses. Second, our data collection is complete with respect to the popular email addresses we monitored, but is incomplete with respect to all the available addresses. As such, any ""volume"" metrics can only serve as a lower bound. Third, we don\'t claim the email dataset is a representative sample of a ""personal inbox"". Intuitively, users (in theory) would use disposable email addresses differently relative to their personal email addresses. Instead, we argue the unique value of this dataset is that it covers a wide range of online services that act as the email senders. The data allows us to empirically study email tracking from the perspective of online services (instead of the perspective of email users). It has been extremely difficult (both technically and ethically) for researchers to access and analyze the email messages in users\' personal inboxes. Our dataset, obtained from public email gateways, allows us to take a first step measuring the email tracking ecosystem.\n', 'C. Ethical Considerations and IRB\n', 'We are aware of the sensitivity of the dataset and have taken active steps to ensure research ethics: (1) We worked closely with IRB to design the study. Our study was reviewed by IRB and received an exemption. (2) Our data collection methodology is designed following a prior research study on disposable SMS services [41]. Like previous researchers, we carefully have controlled the crawling rate to minimize the impact on the respective services. For example, we enforce a 1-second break between queries and explicitly use a singlethread crawler for each service. (3) All the messages sent to the gateways are publicly available to any Internet users. Users are typically informed that other users can also view the emails sent to these addresses. (4) We have spent extensive efforts on detecting and removing PII and personal emails from our dataset (details in §IV-A). (5) After data collection, we made extra efforts to reach out to users and offer users the opportunity to opt out. More specifically, we send out an email to each of the disposable email addresses in our dataset, to inform users of our research activity. We explained the purpose of our research and offered the opportunity for users to withdraw their data. So far, we did not receive any data withdraw request. (6) Throughout our analysis, we\n', ""of emails. twitter and miniclip (for gaming) also fall into the same category. It is possible that some accounts are fake accounts registered by spammers [58]. Since we decided not to back-track (or login into) any individual user's account for ethical considerations, we cannot systematically differentiate them. Previous research on anonymous community (e.g., 4chan, Reddit) show that users prefer anonymized identifiers when posting sensitive or controversial content [54], [33]. We suspect normal users may use the disposable email address to create such social media accounts for similar purposes. PayPal accounts have additional risks. If a user accidentally binds a real credit card to the account, it means any other users may take over the PayPal account by resetting the password.\n"", ""Third, for ethical considerations, we decided not to manually analyze the PII or back-track the accounts registered with the disposable addresses. This has limited our ability to answer some of the questions. For example, in §IV-A, we did not manually confirm the validity of detected PII, assuming the training accuracy transfers well to the testing. In §IV-C, it is possible that spammers would use the email addresses to register fake accounts in online services, but we cannot confirm. Similarly, for the password reset emails, it is possible that the emails were triggered by malicious parties who were trying to login other people's accounts, or by the real owners of the accounts who forgot the password.\n""]","['Password', 'Data collection', 'Registers', 'Logic gates', 'Unsolicited e-mail', 'Monitoring']","['data privacy', 'electronic mail', 'Internet', 'social networking (online)']","['email tracking', 'temporary email addresses', 'large-scale email dataset', 'disposable email addresses', 'pixel tracking', 'disposable email services', 'information leakage']","['Email-Tracking', 'Disposable-Email', 'Privacy']",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835374

Touching the Untouchables Dynamic Security Analysis of the LTE Control Plane,2019,IEEE S&P,True,True,Network Security,none,"['Abstract--This paper presents our extensive investigation of the security aspects of control plane procedures based on dynamic testing of the control components in operational Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. For dynamic testing in LTE networks, we implemented a semi-automated testing tool, named LTEFuzz, by using open-source LTE software over which the user has full control. We systematically generated test cases by defining three basic security properties by closely analyzing the standards. Based on the security property, LTEFuzz generates and sends the test cases to a target network, and classifies the problematic behavior by only monitoring the device-side logs. Accordingly, we uncovered 36 vulnerabilities, which have not been disclosed previously. These findings are categorized into five types: Improper handling of (1) unprotected initial procedure, (2) crafted plain requests, (3) messages with invalid integrity protection, (4) replayed messages, and (5) security procedure bypass. We confirmed those vulnerabilities by demonstrating proof-of-concept attacks against operational LTE networks. The impact of the attacks is to either deny LTE services to legitimate users, spoof SMS messages, or eavesdrop/manipulate user data traffic. Precise root cause analysis and potential countermeasures to address these problems are presented as well. Cellular carriers were partially involved to maintain ethical standards as well as verify our findings in commercial LTE networks.\n', 'We overcome these challenges by utilizing open source LTE implementations [9]-[11] for testing purposes. To this end, we implemented a semi-automated testing tool, named LTEFuzz, by using fully controllable LTE open source software, which 1) dynamically generates and sends the test cases to a target network or a device [9], and further, 2) classifies problematic behavior by only inspecting the responses in the tester and victim device from the target. Second, we collaborated with carriers to avoid ethical issues. For each of the\n', 'By conducting tests against the operational network, we found 51 vulnerabilities (36 new and 15 previously known), which are mainly caused by the improper handling of  unprotected initial procedures,  crafted plain requests,  messages with invalid integrity protection,  replayed messages, and  security procedure bypass. We also demonstrate all the attacks by exploiting the vulnerabilities we found in the operational network while strictly following the ethics. Our attacks can  deny various LTE services to either a target user or arbitrary users,  spoof control plane messages for privacy leaks,  send spoofed Short Message Service (SMS), and  eavesdrop and manipulate data communication. A complete list of vulnerabilities is given in the Table IV in the Appendix.\n', 'D. Ethical considerations\n', 'Carriers and Vendors: Because of ethical and legal restrictions, we were able to only include two carriers in our tests, who are collaborating with us. However, as we have shown in the paper, different vendors and carriers have different vulnerabilities. We plan to collaborate with other carriers and vendors to check their security using LTEFuzz. Furthermore, we could apply our testing method to other control plane protocols such as the S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) and X2 Application Protocol (X2AP) which carry control plane traffic among core network components.

Sonar Detecting SS7 Redirection Attacks with Audio Based Distance Bounding,2018,IEEE S&P,True,True,Networked Systems,none,"['Abstract--The global telephone network is relied upon by billions every day. Central to its operation is the Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol, which is used for setting up calls, managing mobility, and facilitating many other network services. This protocol was originally built on the assumption that only a small number of trusted parties would be able to directly communicate with its core infrastructure. As a result, SS7 -- as a feature -- allows all parties with core access to redirect and intercept calls for any subscriber anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, increased interconnectivity with the SS7 network has led to a growing number of illicit call redirection attacks. We address such attacks with Sonar, a system that detects the presence of SS7 redirection attacks by securely measuring call audio round-trip times between telephony devices. This approach works because redirection attacks force calls to travel longer physical distances than usual, thereby creating longer end-to-end delay. We design and implement a distance bounding-inspired protocol that allows us to securely characterize the round-trip time between the two endpoints. We then use custom hardware deployed in 10 locations across the United States and a redirection testbed to characterize how distance affects round trip time in phone networks. We develop a model using this testbed and show Sonar is able to detect 70.9% of redirected calls between call endpoints of varying attacker proximity (300-7100 miles) with low false positive rates (0.3%). Finally, we ethically perform actual SS7 redirection attacks on our own devices with the help of an industry partner to demonstrate that Sonar detects 100% of such redirections in a real network (with no false positives). As such, we demonstrate that telephone users can reliably detect SS7 redirection attacks and protect the integrity of their calls.\n', 'start of the recording to the beginning of the echoed DTMF tone to obtain the RTT. VoIP-to-VoIP. While we cannot control the path a PSTN call takes through the network, we have some control over the path VoIP traffic takes over an IP network. We therefore seek to also understand how latency and physical distance relate to VoIP calls, and if this model is similar to PSTN calls, which we describe in greater detail below. Acquiring RTT data for VoIP-to-VoIP calls was conducted in a manner similar to the Cellular-to-Cellular calls. We used two PCs running the VoIP software PJSUA [27], where one is the caller and the other is an audio loopback receiver. After the call is established, the caller starts recording the call while simultaneously playing an audio sequence into the stream. The RTT for the call audio is obtained by measuring the time between the echoed audio entering the audio stream and being recorded at the receiver. This is representative of the ""worst case scenario"" for time introduced by rerouting attacks. VoIP-to-Cellular. Finally, because of the difficulty of executing actual SS7 rerouting attacks legally and ethically for a variety of locations, and because no emulator exists, we seek to emulate SS7 redirection attacks. In order to emulate a redirection, we use a VPN to force the IP network traffic for a VoIP call to traverse an additional hop in the network. After traversing the VPN, the call returns to a local Asterisk PBX, connected to a Hybertone GoIP-1 GSM gateway7, which places a cellular call to the cellular echoing device described above. This flow is shown in Figure 6. If RTT and distance are truly correlated, this experiment will influence RTT by augmenting the normal VoIP traffic with an additional network hop, faithfully emulating an SS7 redirection attack.\n', 'With the understanding that distance is correlated to RTT, we now seek to emulate an SS7 attack and measure the effects. As we stated in Section VI, conducting SS7 attacks legally and ethically is difficult. Additionally, no emulator exists to allow us to test this part of our hypothesis on the telephony network. We therefore use the VoIP-to-VoIP measurements to baseline our expectations. As Figure 9 shows, the VoIP-to-VoIP legitimate call RTTs increase similarly with distance to Cellular-to-Cellular calls. However, VoIP-to-VoIP calls have substantially lower RTT than any call we placed over the cellular network. While this is expected given that the telephone network must alter call audio, it provides an additional insight to our methodology: using a VPN to redirect calls will cause a smaller increase in RTT than we would expect from a redirected call in the phone network, making our emulated calls more difficult to detect than a real SS7 attack. We confirm this with real SS7 attacks in section VIII.\n']","['Protocols', 'Telephone sets', 'Sonar detection', 'Telephony', 'Internet', 'Security']","['signalling protocols', 'telecommunication security', 'telephone networks']","['distance bounding-inspired protocol', 'Sonar', 'audio-based distance bounding', 'SS7 network', 'redirection attacks force calls', 'SS7 redirection attacks', 'signaling system 7 protocol', 'United States', 'call audio round-trip times', 'global telephone network']","['telephone security', 'distance bounding', 'SS7']",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8418624

Our methods allowed us to track ransom payments from the acquisition of bitcoins by victims, to the cash-out of bitcoins by the ransomware operators.

Crowd GPS Sec Leveraging Crowdsourcing to Detect and Localize GPS Spoofing Attacks,2018,IEEE S&P,True,False,Devices,none,"[""Abstract--The aviation industry's increasing reliance on GPS to facilitate navigation and air traffic monitoring opens new attack vectors with the purpose of hijacking UAVs or interfering with air safety. We propose Crowd-GPS-Sec to detect and localize GPS spoofing attacks on moving airborne targets such as UAVs or commercial airliners. Unlike previous attempts to secure GPS, Crowd-GPS-Sec neither requires any updates of the GPS infrastructure nor of the airborne GPS receivers, which are both unlikely to happen in the near future. In contrast, Crowd-GPS-Sec leverages crowdsourcing to monitor the air traffic from GPS-derived position advertisements that aircraft periodically broadcast for air traffic control purposes. Spoofing attacks are detected and localized by an independent infrastructure on the ground which continuously analyzes the contents and the times of arrival of these advertisements. We evaluate our system with real-world data from a crowdsourced air traffic monitoring sensor network and by simulations. We show that Crowd-GPS-Sec is able to globally detect GPS spoofing attacks in less than two seconds and to localize the attacker up to an accuracy of 150 meters after 15 minutes of monitoring time.\n"", ""Driven by the increasing threat and the lack of realistic short-term solutions, we propose Crowd-GPS-Sec, a system that detects and localizes GPS spoofing attacks on aerial vehicles without the need to update the structure of the GPS satellites' signals nor the logic of the airborne GPS receivers. Crowd-GPS-Sec leverages crowdsourcing to monitor the position advertisements derived from GPS that aircraft and UAVs periodically broadcast for air traffic surveillance. Using\n"", '· We present algorithms for the detection of GPS spoofing attacks on airborne targets by using aircraft reports and multilateration.\n', 'While in the past, radar and inertial systems used to be the two main localization technologies in aviation, GPS is today often the preferred solution due to its superior accuracy. Modern airliners, smaller aircraft, gliders, helicopters, or UAVs are almost all equipped with GPS receivers. GPS is typically used by pilots or UAVs for self-localization but the technology is also used for remote air-traffic surveillance and collisionavoidance applications. In the latter cases, aerial vehicles are required to periodically broadcast position and velocity advertisements to inform neighboring aircraft and ground controllers about their presence. Larger aerial vehicles generally transmit those messages over the Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) system while smaller and slower vehicles rely on the Flarm [28] system. Irrespective of the used system, these advertisements contain a position that is directly derived from airborne GPS receivers as depicted in Figure 1.\n']","['Global Positioning System', 'Aircraft', 'Receivers', 'Monitoring', 'Satellite broadcasting', 'Transponders', 'Atmospheric modeling']","['air traffic control', 'Global Positioning System', 'sensors']","['spoofing attacks detection', 'spoofing attacks localization', 'GPS infrastructure', 'crowdsourced air traffic monitoring sensor network', 'air traffic control purposes', 'GPS-derived position advertisements', 'Crowd-GPS-Sec leverages', 'airborne GPS receivers']","['GPS', 'ADS B', 'Spoofing Detection', 'Spoofer Localization', 'Localization Security']",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8418651

Augur Internet Wide Detection of Connectivity Disruptions,2017,IEEE S&P,True,True,Bitcoin and Distributed Systems,none,"['Despite the conceptual appeal of this approach, realizing the method poses many challenges. One challenge concerns ethics: Using this method can make it appear as though a user in some country is attempting to communicate with a potentially censored destination, which could imperil users. To abide by the ethical guidelines set out by the Menlo [19] and Belmont [9] reports, we exercise great care to ensure that we perform our measurements from Internet infrastructure (e.g., routers, middleboxes), as opposed to user machines. A second challenge concerns statistical robustness in the face\n', ""We begin in Section II with a discussion of related work. In Section III, we provide an overview of our method. We present Augur in Section IV, introducing the principles behind using IP ID side channels for third-party measurement of censorship; discussing how to identify remote systems that enable us to conduct our measurements in an ethically responsible manner; and delving into the extensive considerations required for robust inference. In Section V, we present a concrete implementation of Augur. In Section VI, we validate Augur's accuracy and provide an accompanying analysis of global censorship practices observed during our measurement run. We offer thoughts related to further developing our approach in Section VII and conclude in Section VIII.\n"", ""We first present a high-level overview of the strategy underlying our method, which we base on inducing and observing potential increments in an Internet host's IP ID field. The technique relies on causing one host on the Internet to send traffic to another (potentially blocked) Internet destination; thus, we also consider the ethics of the approach. Finally, we discuss the details of the method, including how we select the specific Internet endpoints used to conduct the measurements.\n"", '· Ethical. The system design must satisfy the ethical principles from the Belmont [9] and Menlo [19] Reports: respect for people, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest.\n', 'C. Ethics\n', 'Salganik explains that the inability to obtain informed consent does not by itself reflect a disregard of respect for humans [44]. Rather, we must take other appropriate measures to ensure that we are abiding by the ethical principles from the Belmont [9] and Menlo [19] reports. To do so, we develop a method that reduces the likelihood that we are directly involving any humans in our experiments in the first place, by focusing our measurements on infrastructure. Specifically, our method works to limit the endpoints that we use as reflectors to likely Internet infrastructure (e.g., routers in the access or transit networks, middleboxes), as opposed to hosts that belong to individual citizens (e.g., laptops, desktops, home routers, consumer devices). To do so, we use the CAIDA Ark dataset [11], which contains traceroute measurements to all routed /24 networks. We include a reflector in our experiments only if it appears in an Ark traceroute at least two hops away from the traceroute endpoint. The Ark dataset is not comprehensive, as the traceroute measurements are conducted to a randomly selected IP address in each /24 prefix. Restricting the set of infrastructure devices to those that appear in Ark restricts the IP addresses we might be able to discover with a more comprehensive scan.\n', ""\x0cbe held accountable for the perceived actions performed by the machines. Our techniques do not eliminate risk. Rather, in accordance with the ethical guideline of beneficence, they reduce it to the point where the benefits of collecting these measurements may outweigh the risks of collecting them. In keeping with Salganik's recommendations [44], we aim to conduct measurements that pose a minimal additional risk, given both the nature of the spoofed packets and the potential benefits of the research.\n"", 'The Internet-wide scans we conduct using ZMap [20] to detect possible reflectors introduce concerns related to respect for law and public interest. Part of the respect of law and public interest is to reduce the network load we induce on reflectors and sites, to the extent possible, as unnecessary network load could drive costs higher for the operators of reflectors and sites; if excessive, the probing traffic could also impede network performance. To mitigate these possible effects, we follow the approach for ethical scanning behavior as outlined by Durumeric et al. [20]: we signal the benign intent of our scans in the WHOIS entries and DNS records for our scanning IPs, and provide project details on a website hosted on each scanning machine. We extensively tested our scanning methods prior to their deployment; we also respect opt-out requests.\n', 'The ethical principle of justice states that the parties bearing the risk should be the same as those reaping the benefits; the parties who would bear the risk (users in the countries where censorship is taking place) may ultimately reap some benefit from the knowledge about filtering that our tools provide through improved circumvention tools and better information about what is blocked.\n', '1) Infrastructure machine. To satisfy the ethical guidelines that we outlined in Section III-C, the reflector should be Internet infrastructure, as opposed to a user machine.\n', 'All Viable Ethically Usable Experiment Sample\n', 'TABLE I: Summary of our reflector datasets.

Those ethically usable are routers at least two hops away from traceroute endpoints in the Ark data, and we select a random subset as our experiment set.\n', 'Ethically Usable\n', 'TABLE II: The distribution of countries containing reflectors across continents. Note the continent coverage of our experiment sample is identical to that of the ethically usable dataset, as we sampled at least one ethically usable reflector per country in that dataset. The continent labels are as follows: AF=Africa, AS=Asia, EU=Europe, NA=North America, SA=South America, OC=Oceana/Australia. We also label ME=Middle East, as a region with frequent censorship.\n', '\x0cThe Internet-wide ZMap scan found 140 million reachable hosts. Approximately 22.7 million of these demonstrated use of a shared, monotonically increasing IP ID. These reflectors were geographically distributed across 234 countries around the world, with a median of 1,667 reflectors per country. This initial dataset provides a massive worldwide set of reflectors to potentially measure, yet many may be home routers, servers, or user machines that we cannot use for experimentation due to ethical considerations.\n', 'Coverage limitations. Ethical considerations when performing our measurements restricted the reflectors from which we measure to a set of hosts that we can confidently conclude represent Internet infrastructure in the interior of the network. Recall that we do so by measuring the Internet topology and only using reflectors at least two traceroute hops into the network. This approach drastically reduces the number of hosts that we can use as reflectors. In the future, more exhaustive techniques to identify Internet infrastructure could increase the set of IP addresses that we might use as reflectors.\n', '\x0cthat we do not control. This ability to conduct measurements from ""third-party"" vantage points that we control allows us to continuously monitor many more paths than was previously possible.

A Practical Oblivious Map Data Structure with Secure Deletion and History Independence,2016,IEEE S&P,True,False,Oblivious and snarky,none,"['Abstract--We present a new oblivious RAM that supports variable-sized storage blocks (vORAM), which is the first ORAM to allow varying block sizes without trivial padding. We also present a new history-independent data structure (a HIRB tree) that can be stored within a vORAM. Together, this construction provides an efficient and practical oblivious data structure (ODS) for a key/value map, and goes further to provide an additional privacy guarantee as compared to prior ODS maps: even upon client compromise, deleted data and the history of old operations remain hidden to the attacker. We implement and measure the performance of our system using Amazon Web Services, and the single-operation time for a realistic database (up to 256K entries) is less than 1 second. This represents a 100x speed-up compared to the current best oblivious map data structure (which provides neither secure deletion nor history independence) by Wang et al. (CCS 14).\n', 'Similar observations for ORAMs more generally were made recently by Bindschaedler et al. [12], who examined existing ORAM alternatives in a realistic cloud setting, and found many theoretical results lacking in practice. We ask a related question for ODS, and answer it in the affirmative with our HIRB data structure stored in vORAM:\n', 'Specifically, our vORAM+HIRB construction will provide strong security for deleted data, as well as a weaker (yet optimal) security for the history of past operations, after complete client compromise.\n', 'HIRB. We developed a new data structure, called a HIRB tree (history independent, randomized B-tree), that satisfies all the aforementioned requirements. Conceptually, it is a fixed height B-tree such that when each item is inserted, the level in HIRB tree is determined by log n trials of (pseudorandom) biased coin flipping where  is the block factor. The tree may split or merge depending on the situation, but it never rotates. The fixed height of the tree, i.e. H = 1 + log n, is very beneficial for efficiency. In particular, every operation visits at most 2H nodes, which greatly saves on padding costs, compared to the ODS scheme of [11] where each AVL tree operation must be padded up to visiting 3 · 1.44 · lg n nodes.\n', 'The HIRB is described more carefully in Section V, with full details in the appendix.\n', 'vORAM. One challenge with HIRB trees is that number of items that each tree node contains are variable, and in the unlucky case, it may become too large for an ORAM bucket to store.\n', 'We observe that the irregularity of the HIRB node sizes can be smoothed over O(log n) buckets from the vORAM root to an vORAM leaf, and we prove that the stash size on the client can still be small O~(log n) with high probability. We note that vORAM is the first ORAM that deals with variable size blocks, and may be of independent interest.\n', 'Secure deletion. Finally, for secure deletion, a parent vORAM bucket contains the encryption keys of both children. When a bucket is modified, it is encrypted with a fresh key; then the encryption keys in the parent are accordingly modified, which recursively affects all its ancestors. However, we stress that in each vORAM operation, leaf-to-root refreshing takes place anyway, and adding this mechanism is bandwidthfree. Additionally, instead of using the label of each item directly in HIRB, we use the hash of the label. This way, we can remove the dependency between the item location in\n', '\x0cHIRB and its label (with security proven in the random oracle model).\n', 'In all cases the remotely stored B-Tree is the fastest as it requires the least amount of communication cost (no obliviousness). For similar reasons, vORAM+HIRB is much faster than the baseline as the number of items grows (starting from 214 items), since the baseline requires communication that is linear in the number of items. We also describe a number of optimizations (such as concurrent connections and caching) that enables vORAM+HIRB to be competitive with the baseline even when storing as few as 29 items. It should be noted, without optimizations, the access time is on the order of a few seconds, and with optimizations, access times are less than one second.\n', 'Surprisingly, however, the vORAM+HIRB is 20x faster than ORAM+AVL, irrespective of the number of items, even though ORAM+AVL does not support history independence or secure deletion. We believe this is mainly because vORAM+HIRB requires much smaller round complexity. Two factors drive the round complexity improvement:\n', 'Much smaller height: While each AVL tree node contains only one item, each HIRB node contains  items on average, and is able to take advantage of slightly larger buckets which optimize the bandwidth to remote cloud storage by storing the same amount of data in trees with smaller height.\n', 'Much less padding: AVL tree operations sometimes get complicated with balancing and rotations, due to which each operation should be padded up to 3 · 1.44 lg n node accesses. However, HIRB operations are simple, do not require rotations, and thus, each operation accesses at most 2 log n nodes.\n', 'Although the Path-ORAM bucket for ORAM+AVL is four times smaller than the vORAM bucket in our implementation, it affects bandwidth but not the round complexity. The fully optimized vORAM+HIRB protocol is about 100x faster than ORAM+AVL. We describe the details of our experiments in Section VI.\n', '· The design and analysis of a new history independent and randomized data structure, the HIRB tree;\n', '· The implementation and measurement of the vORAM+HIRB system in the actual cloud setting.\n', '\x0cOur vORAM construction builds upon the non-recursive Path ORAM [11] and allows variable sized data items to be spread across multiple ORAM buckets. Although our original motivation was to store differing-sized B-tree nodes from the HIRB, there may be wider applicability to any context where the size (as well as contents and access patterns) to data needs to be hidden.\n', 'History independence. History independence of data structures requires that the current organization of the data within the structure reveals nothing about the prior operations thereon. Micciancio [23] first considered history independence in the context of 2-3 trees, and the notions of history independence were formally developed in [24]-[26]. The notion of strong history independence [24] holds if for any two sequences of operations, the distributions of the memory representations are identical at all time-points that yield the same storage content. Moreover, a data structure is strongly history independent if and only if it has a unique representation [25]. There have been uniquely-represented constructions for hash functions [27], [28] and variants of a B-tree (a B-treap [29], and a B-skip-list [30]). We adopt the notion of unique representation for history independence when developing our history independent, randomized B-tree, or HIRB tree.\n', 'The design of vORAM is based on the non-recursive version of Path ORAM [9], but we are able to add more flexibility by allowing each ORAM bucket to contain as many variable-size blocks (or parts of blocks) as the bucket space allows. We will show that vORAM preserves obliviousness and maintains a small stash as long as the size of variable blocks can be bounded by a geometric probability distribution, which is the case for the HIRB that we intend to store within the vORAM. To support secure deletion, we also store encryption keys within each bucket for its two children, and these keys are regenerated on every access, similarly to other work on secure deletion [17], [34].\n', 'Stash size. Our vORAM construction maintains a small stash as long as the size of variable blocks can be bounded by a geometric probability distribution, which is the case for the HIRB that we intend to store within the vORAM.\n', '\x0cV. HIRB TREE DATA STRUCTURE\n', 'Motivating the HIRB. Before describing the construction and properties of the history independent, randomized B-Tree (HIRB), we first wish to motivate the need for the HIRB as it relates to the security and efficiently requirements of storing it within the vORAM:\n', 'While some form of hash table might seem like an obvious choice, we note that such a structure would violate the second condition above; namely, it would be impossible to store a hash table within an ORAM without having a separate position map, incurring an extra logarithmic factor in the cost. As it turns out, our HIRB tree does use hashing in order to support secure deletion, but this is only to sort the labels within the tree data structure.\n', 'Overview of HIRB tree. The closest data structure to the HIRB is the B-Skip List [30]; unfortunately, a skip list does not form a tree. The HIRB is essentially equivalent to a BSkip List after sorting labels according to a hash function and removing pointers between skip-nodes to impose a top-down tree structure.\n', 'HIRB tree nodes differ from typical B-tree nodes in two ways. First, instead of storing the label in the node a cryptographic hash3 of the label is stored.

Following the discussion after Theorem 4, we could also reduce the leakage in vORAM+HIRB to O(n/ log2 n), with constant-factor increase in bandwidth, which again is optimal according to Theorem 1.\n', 'We completed two empirical analyses of the vORAM+HIRB system. First, we sought to determine the most effective size for vORAM buckets with respect to the expected block size, i.e., the ratio Z/B.

In the Path ORAM, the best corresponding theoretical ratio is 5, whereas it has been shown experimentally that a ratio of 4 will also work, even in the worst case [9].\n', 'B. Measuring vORAM+HIRB Performance\n', 'We measured the performance of our vORAM+HIRB implementation on a real data set of reasonable size, and compared to some alternative methods for storing a remote map data structure that provide varying levels of security and efficiency. All of our implementations used the same client/server setup, with a Python3 implementation and AWS as the cloud provider, in order to give a fair comparison.\n', 'Optimized vORAM+HIRB implementation. We fully implemented our vORAM+HIRB map data structure using Python3 and Amazon Web Services as the cloud service provider. We used AES256 for encryption in vORAM, and used SHA1 to generate labels for the HIRB. In our setting, we considered a client running on the local machine that maintained the erasable memory, and the server (the cloud) provided the persistent storage with a simple get/set interface to store or retrieve a given (encrypted) vORAM bucket.\n', 'For the vORAM buckets, we choose Z/B = 6 based on the prior experiments, and a bucket size of 4K, which is the preferred back-end transfer size for AWS, and was also the bucket size used by [12]. One of the advantages of the vORAM over other ORAMs is that the bucket size can be set to match the storage requirements with high bucket utilization. The settings for the HIRB were then selected based on Theorem 8 and based on that, we calculated a  = 12 for the sample data (labels and values) stored within the HIRB. The label, value, and associated vORAM identifiers total 56 bytes per item.\n', 'Comparison baselines.

The method involves maintaining a single, fixed-size encrypted file transferred back and forth between the server and client and re-encrypted on each access. While this solution is cumbersome for large sizes, it is the obvious solution for small databases and thus provides a useful baseline. Furthermore, we are not aware of any other method (other than vORAM+HIRB) to provide obliviousness, securedeletion, and history independence.\n', '· ORAM+AVL: We implemented the ODS proposed by [11] of an AVL embedded within an non-recursive Path ORAM. Note that ORAM+AVL does not provide secure deletion nor history independence. We used the same cryptographic settings as our vORAM+HIRB implementation, and used 256 byte blocks for each AVL node, which was the smallest size we could achieve without additional optimizations. As recommended by [9], we stored Z = 4 fixed-size blocks in each bucket, for a total of 1K bucket size. Note that this bucket size is less than the 4K transfer size recommended by the cloud storage, which reflects the limitation of ORAM+AVL in that it cannot effectively utilize larger buckets. We add the observation that, when the same experiments were run with 4K size buckets (more wasted bandwidth, but\n', 'matching the other experiments), the timings did not change by more than 1 second, indicating that the 4K bucket size is a good choice for the AWS back-end. · SD-B-Tree: As another comparison point, we implemented a remotely stored B-Tree with secure deletion where each node is encrypted with a key stored in the parent with re-keying for each access, much as described by Reardon et al. [17]. While this solution provides secure deletion, and stores all data encrypted, it does not provide obliviousness nor history independence. Again, we used AES256 encryption, with  = 110 for the B-tree max internal node size in order to optimize 4K-size blocks. In terms of security, only our vORAM+HIRB as well as the naive baseline provide obliviousness, secure deletion, and history independence. The ORAM+AVL provides obliviousness only, and the SD-B-Tree is most vulnerable to leaking information in the cloud, as it provides secure deletion only. In terms of asymptotic performance, the SD-B-Tree is fastest, requiring only O(log n) data transfer per operation. The vORAM+HIRB and ORAM+AVL both require O(log2 n) data transfer per operation, although as discussed previously the vORAM+HIRB saves a considerable constant factor. The naive baseline requires O(n) transfer per operation, albeit with the smallest possible constant factor.\n', 'Experimental results. The primary result of the experiment is presented in Figure 11 where we compared the time (in seconds) for a single access.

Each AVL operation entails 3 · 1.44 lg N ORAM operations as compared to just 2 log N vORAM operations for the HIRB. This difference in communication cost is easily observed in Table I. Overall, we see that the storage and communication costs for vORAM+HIRB are not too much larger than that for a secure deletion B-tree, which does not provide any access pattern hiding as the oblivious alternatives do.\n"", 'Put simply, the vORAM+HIRB and SD-B-Tree are the only implementations which can be considered practical for real data sizes, and the benefit of vORAM+HIRB is its considerable additional security guarantees of oblivious and bounded history independence.\n', 'In this paper, we have shown a new secure cloud storage system combining the previously disjoint security properties of obliviousness, secure deletion, and history independence.

The Cracked Cookie Jar HTTP Cookie Hijacking and the Exposure of Private Information,2016,IEEE S&P,True,True,Don't go on the Web,approved,"[""In this paper, we conduct an in-depth assessment of a diverse set of major websites and explore what functionality and information is exposed to attackers that have hijacked a user's HTTP cookies. We identify a recurring pattern across websites with partially deployed HTTPS; service personalization inadvertently results in the exposure of private information. The separation of functionality across multiple cookies with different scopes and inter-dependencies further complicates matters, as imprecise access control renders restricted account functionality accessible to non-session cookies. Our cookie hijacking study reveals a number of severe flaws; attackers can obtain the user's home and work address and visited websites from Google, Bing and Baidu expose the user's complete search history, and Yahoo allows attackers to extract the contact list and send emails from the user's account. Furthermore, e-commerce vendors such as Amazon and Ebay expose the user's purchase history (partial and full respectively), and almost every website exposes the user's name and email address. Ad networks like Doubleclick can also reveal pages the user has visited. To fully evaluate the practicality and extent of cookie hijacking, we explore multiple aspects of the online ecosystem, including mobile apps, browser security mechanisms, extensions and search bars. To estimate the extent of the threat, we run IRB-approved measurements on a subset of our university's public wireless network for 30 days, and detect over 282K accounts exposing the cookies required for our hijacking attacks. We also explore how users can protect themselves and find that, while mechanisms such as the EFF's HTTPS Everywhere extension can reduce the attack surface, HTTP cookies are still regularly exposed. The privacy implications of these attacks become even more alarming when considering how they can be used to deanonymize Tor users. Our measurements suggest that a significant portion of Tor users may currently be vulnerable to cookie hijacking.\n"", ""We conduct an IRB-approved measurement study on a subset of our university's public wireless network, to understand the browsing behavior of users when connected to unprotected public networks. On average, we detect more than 8K unique accounts exposing their cookies for hijacking each day. Our measurements have the sole purpose of estimating the number of users that are susceptible to hijacking attacks; we do not access any user accounts, collect any personal information, or attempt to deanonymize any users.\n"", ""Due to the practicality of these attacks and the pervasiveness of the vulnerable websites, we investigate how cookie hijacking can lead to the deanonymization of Tor users. In our IRB-approved study, we find that 75% of the outgoing connections from a new exit node are over HTTP. Based on the comparison to the respective measurements from our university's wireless network, we believe that a large number of Tor users may be exposed to HTTP cookie hijacking and susceptible to deanonymization.\n"", 'The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section II we offer background information, and motivation for our work through a network traffic study. In Section III we offer details on our analysis of cookie hijacking attacks against popular services, and explore the collateral exposure of user cookies by mobile apps and browser components in Section IV. We explore the deanonymization risk that Tor users face in Section V, and discuss general countermeasures against cookie hijacking in Section VI. We address the ethical aspects of our research in Section VII, discuss related work in Section VIII, and conclude in Section IX.\n', ""IRB. Before conducting any experiments, we submitted a request to our Institutional Review Board that clearly described our research goals, collection methodology, and the type of data to be collected. Once the request was approved, we worked closely with the Network Security team of our university's IT department for conducting the data collection and analysis in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.\n"", 'Ethics. Again, we obtained IRB approval for our experiments. However, due to our ethical considerations for the Tor users (as they are not members of our university nor connecting to our public wireless network), we do not replicate the data collection we followed in our experiment\n', 'VII. ETHICS AND DISCLOSURE\n', ""To ensure the ethical nature of our research, we provided a detailed description of our data collection and analysis process to Columbia University's IRB, and obtained approval for both our experiments with the public wireless network and the Tor network. Furthermore, all captured data was destroyed after the end of our evaluation measurements.\n"", 'Disclosing attacks against popular services raises ethical issues as, one might argue, adversaries may have previously lacked the know-how to conduct these attacks. However the practicality of cookie hijacking suggests that such attacks could soon happen in the wild (if not happening already). To that end, we have already contacted all the audited websites to disclose our findings in detail. We have also contacted Tor developers to inform them of the deanonymization threat users face. We believe that by shedding light on this significant privacy threat, we can incentivize services to streamline support for ubiquitous encryption. Furthermore, we must alert users of the privacy risks they face when connecting to public wireless networks or browsing through Tor, and educate them on the extent of protection offered by existing mechanisms.\n', ""In this paper we presented our extensive in-depth study on the privacy threats that users face when attackers steal their HTTP cookies. We audited a wide range of major services and found that cookie hijacking attacks are not limited to a specific type of websites, but pose a widespread threat to any website that does not enforce ubiquitous encryption. Our study revealed numerous instances of major services exposing private information and protected account functionality to non-authenticated cookies. This threat is not restricted to websites, as users' cookies are also exposed by official browser extensions, search bars and mobile apps. To obtain a better understanding of the risk posed by passive eavesdroppers in practice, we conducted an IRB-approved measurement study and detected that a large portion of the outgoing traffic in public wireless networks remains unencrypted, thus, exposing a significant amount of users to cookie hijacking attacks. We also evaluated the protection offered by popular browsersupported security mechanisms, and found that they can reduce the attack surface but can not protect users if websites do not support ubiquitous encryption. The practicality and pervasiveness of these attacks, also renders them a significant threat\n""]","['Browsers', 'Privacy', 'Wireless networks', 'Monitoring', 'Cryptography', 'Google']","['authorisation', 'data privacy', 'online front-ends', 'Web sites']","['HTTP cookie hijacking', 'private information exposure', 'online privacy', 'hijacking attacks', 'Web sites', 'HTTPS', 'ubiquitous encryption', 'critical functionality access', 'sensitive data access', 'HTTP cookies', 'service personalization', 'access control', 'nonsession cookies', 'Google', 'Bing', 'Baidu', 'Yahoo', 'online ecosystem', 'mobile apps', 'browser security', 'search bars', 'IRB-approved measurements', 'university public wireless network']",[],https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7546532

Therefore, we describe our results such that they cannot be directly applied by botmasters to harden their botnets. On a reassuring note, several detailed strategies for resilient P2P botnet designs have been publicly proposed, but we do not know of any real botnets that make use of these ideas [22, 31, 32, 10].

Moreover, we believe that legal and ethical considerations mandate discussion of how conduct such experiments safely, mitigating harm to others. For each of these four ""cornerstones of prudent experimentation"", we now outline more specific aspects and describe guidelines to ensure prudence.

We describe our data collection and analysis methodology in Sections III and IV. We convey our main results in Section V, and address their generalizability and ethical considerations in Section VI. We conclude in Section VII by discussing the implications of our results for future research and for defining practical password-composition policies.\n', 'We use six publicly available word lists as training data in our analysis and to assemble the blacklists used in some of our experimental conditions. The RockYou password set [24] includes more than 30 million passwords, and the MySpace password set [47] contains about 45,000 passwords. (We discuss ethical considerations related to these datasets in Section VI.) The inflection list1 contains 250,000 words in varied grammatical forms such as plurals and past tense. The simple dictionary contains about 200,000 words and is a standard English dictionary available on most Unix systems.

Most of our results rely on passwords collected via a user study (approved by our institution's IRB). However, we also use the RockYou and MySpace password lists. Although these have collectively been used by a number of scientific works that study passwords (e.g., [2], [13], [25], [30]), this nevertheless creates an ethical conundrum: Should our research use passwords acquired illicitly? Since this data has already been made public and is easily available, using it in our research does not increase the harm to the victims. We use these passwords only to train and test guessing algorithms, and not in relationship with any usernames or other login information. Furthermore, as attackers are likely to use these password sets as training sets or cracking dictionaries, our use of them to evaluate password strength implies our results are more likely to be of practical relevance to security administrators.\n""]","['Training', 'Electronic mail', 'Dictionaries', 'Entropy', 'Calculators', 'Resistance', 'Atmospheric measurements']",['authorisation'],"['password strength measurement', 'password-cracking algorithms', 'text-based passwords', 'authentication method', 'password cracking', 'password composition policies', 'heuristic password-guessing algorithms', 'training sets', 'entropy estimates', 'password security']","['authentication', 'passwords', 'user study']",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6234434

Memoir Practical State Continuity for Protected Modules,2011,IEEE S&P,True,False,Program Security Analysis,none,"[""We define two low-level specs, one for MemoirBasic and one for Memoir-Opt. The Memoir-Basic spec contains variables that model the disk, the RAM, and the TPM's NVRAM. There are seven actions: The MakeOperationAvailable action is an abstraction that directly corresponds to a MakeRequestAvailable action in the high-level spec. The PerformOperation and RepeatOperation actions read and write the RAM and NVRAM in the manner described in §III-B. ReadDisk and WriteDisk exchange data between the disk and the RAM. The Restart action clears the RAM.\n"", 'We prove that the Memoir-Basic spec implements the high-level spec: Any sequence of actions in the MemoirBasic spec corresponds to a legal sequence of actions in the high-level spec. In particular, MakeOperationAvailable corresponds to MakeRequestAvailable; PerformOperation corresponds to AdvanceState; and the remaining five lowlevel actions have no effect on the high-level variables. Finally, we prove that the Memoir-Opt spec implements the Memoir-Basic spec, which transitively implies that it implements the high-level spec.\n', 'Figure 10 shows the results. Without any state protection, the cost is essentially just the inherent cost of launching a protection module in Flicker, about 50 ms. Confidentiality and integrity protection costs an additional 7 ms, mostly due to the cost of reading the symmetric key out of NVRAM. Rollback resistance costs an additional 76 ms beyond that, essentially all due to synchronously writing the request to disk (43 ms) before invoking the module and writing NVRAM to store the 20-byte history summary (33 ms). Finally, Memoir-Opt saves 17 ms compared to MemoirBasic, because it avoids the NVRAM write but incurs an additional 16 ms to read and extend the PCR.\n']","['Autobiographies', 'Random access memory', 'Nonvolatile memory', 'Computer crashes', 'Radiation detectors', 'Cryptography', 'Hardware']","['security of data', 'software architecture']","['security architecture', 'Memoir', 'deterministic module', 'NVRAM']",[],https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5958041

Click Trajectories End to End Analysis of the Spam Value Chain,2011,IEEE S&P,True,True,Underground Economy/Malware,not required,"['Legal and ethical concerns: This purchasing portion of our study involved the most careful consideration of legal and ethical concerns, particularly because this level of active involvement has not been common in the academic community to date. We worked with both our own project legal advisors and with general counsel to design a protocol for purchasing, handling, analyzing and disposing of these products within a legal framework that minimizes any risk of harm to others. While the full accounting of the legal considerations are outside the scope of this paper, most of our effort revolved around item selection and controls. For example, we restricted our pharmaceutical purchasing to non-prescription goods such as herbal and over-thecounter products, and we restricted our software purchases to items for which we already possessed a site license (also\n', 'Finally, while these controls are designed to prevent any explicit harm from resulting through the study, a remaining issue concerns the ethics of any implicit harm caused by supporting merchants (through our purchasing) who are themselves potentially criminal or unethical. Since our study does not deal with human subjects our institutional review board did not deem it appropriate for their review. Thus, our decision to move forward is based on our own subjective evaluation (along with the implicit oversight we received from university counsel and administration). In this, we believe that, since any such implicit support of these merchants is small (no individual affiliate program received more than $277 dollars from us), the potential value from better understanding their ecosystem vastly outweighs the potential harm.11\n', ""This is, again, the most ambitious measurement effort our team has attempted and even with 15 authors it would have been impossible without help from many other individuals and organizations.

The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we want to understand whether the vulnerabilities we discovered in merchant software can indeed be used against real online businesses, thereby posing a credible and imminent security threat; second, we hope to understand a number of aspects related to the exploits in real-world settings, such as how detectable the exploits are by regular auditing processes of the stores, how anonymous the attacks can be, and how various parties would respond to our bug reporting. To this end, we executed a series of exploit analyses within the ethical and legal boundary, as elaborated below. Responsible experiment design. We carefully designed our evaluation strategy in order to carry out our experiments in a responsible manner. The entire study was conducted under the guidance of a lawyer at Indiana University. We strictly followed the principles below when performing exploits on real-world online stores: (1) we performed no intrusion of either merchant websites or CaaS services; (2) we ensured that no financial damage was inflicted upon the merchants involved, by canceling orders when possible, returning items, paying for unpaid balances, or placing orders in a special way (e.g., making two separate orders, one with a lower price and the other with a higher price); (3) we\n', '[13] Benjamin Cox, J.

For example, consider a car\'s Central Locking Systems (CLS), which controls the power door locking mechanism. Clearly this system must monitor the physical door lock switches, wireless input from any remote key fob (for keyless entry), and remote telematics commands to open the doors.

To this end we created, deployed, and monitored 1008 realistic decoy Facebook accounts (for ethical reasons, it is not possible for us to study accounts that belong to real persons, to avoid harming them). We incorporated various age and gender configurations in the accounts. To lure criminals into interacting with the accounts, we leaked credentials to a subset of them on the Surface Web and Dark Web, mimicking the modus operandi of cybercriminals that distribute stolen account credentials. We monitored the accounts for six months, extracted comprehensive activity records of people who visited the accounts, and analyzed those records offline.\n', 'In addition to regular accounts, Facebook provides sandboxed accounts that are disconnected from their main social graph. These accounts, known as test accounts, are similar to real accounts, but exist in an isolated environment (a sandbox). Hence, they cannot connect to regular Facebook accounts, but can connect to other test accounts (i.e., as ""friends""). They are often used for testing purposes, for instance, in security vulnerability testing [6]. The inherent isolation of test accounts makes them particularly suitable for our studies in understanding malicious activity in compromised social accounts, since it ensures that real users will not be harmed in any way during experiments, and this matches our ethics requirements for studies of this nature. We discuss these ethical considerations in Section 3.5. At the same time, we ensure that the accounts look believable. Facebook also provides a dashboard for managing test accounts. The dashboard, which is accessible only from a real Facebook account, allows the account manager to reset passwords of test accounts under their control.\n', 'We ensured that the accounts looked realistic by populating them with real-world data and connecting them with each other (i.e., friend connections). Our accounts stopped posting messages and interacting with each other shortly before the credentials were leaked (we discuss those leaks in Section 3.3). From that point, the only activity we carried out was accepting the friend requests that the attackers made. We did not drive any further activity from the accounts. In particular, we did not interact with any attacker, for example by replying to their private messages. This was primarily done to follow our IRB protocol, which forbade us from interacting with attackers (see Section 3.5 for more details).\n', '3.5 Ethics\n', 'We carefully considered the ethical implications of our work while setting up and running experiments. First, we used accounts that were isolated from the regular Facebook social graph to avoid harming legitimate Facebook users. This sandbox approach is in line with common practices in malware research [44]. Second, we used publicly available stock photos and tweets to populate the accounts. We did this to ensure that no private information was leaked in this study. Third, by leveraging the test dashboard, we ensured that account passwords could be changed easily by us, to lock criminals out, if we observed attempts to harm people via honey accounts. In addition, our monitor system recorded all attempts to change the email addresses associated with the honey accounts. Our initial mitigation plan was to connect to such accounts and restore their original email addresses, which were under our control. We later found that Facebook already had a mitigation mechanism in place: attempts to change email addresses were blocked by Facebook, and access to the affected accounts was temporarily disabled until we reset them via the test dashboard.\n', ""\x0cTo further strengthen our ethics protocol, we asked our Facebook contacts to keep an eye on the accounts with a view to shutting down any account that violates Facebook's policies. After our analysis, we securely discarded PII that accrued in the accounts during experiments. Finally, since our experiments involved deceiving criminals to interact with decoy accounts, we sought and obtained ethics approval from our institution prior to starting experiments.\n"", '284 (46%) of the functional leaked accounts received unauthorized accesses. We did not leak 307 accounts. Unfortunately, due to the sandboxed nature of these accounts, it was not possible for attackers to find these accounts independently and connect to them. This study cannot therefore estimate the difference in risk of leaked and unleaked accounts. We did however observe that 46 unleaked accounts (15%) received interactions by attackers, in the form of friend requests or private messages. It is possible that some of these were an attempt to further gain access to those unleaked accounts. However, our inability to interact with attackers, because of our IRB protocol, did not allow us to investigate this further.\n', '\x0cour dataset, the adult accounts suffered much more from the addition or removal of friends than teen accounts. A possible explanation for this is that previous research reported that older people are disproportionately affected by online fraud, for example romance scams [30, 50, 58]. It is possible that the attackers were trying to reach potential victims by making friends requests. Unfortunately, since our IRB protocol did not allow us to interact with criminals, we could not reply to any conversation and understand the purpose of the connection.\n', ""Gender. In our dataset, female accounts received more friend requests than male accounts (126 vs 31). A potential reason is that multiple studies reported that women are more likely to receive online abuse like sexual harassment [22, 36, 51]. It is possible that these malicious actions had the goal of harassing the victim, whether sexually or otherwise. Another possible explanation lies in the fact that previous research observed that fraudsters engaging in romance scams were often posing as older men and targeting women [30, 50, 58]. It is possible that cybercriminals were aiming to contact women's accounts to potentially defraud them. Since our IRB protocol did not allow us to interact with criminals, we could not reply to the messages received by our accounts to better understand the intentions of the attacker.\n"", 'In the course of experiments, private messages and timeline posts were written to some honey accounts by criminals. We did not respond to any of them as dictated by our IRB protocol. This may have affected the perception of the criminals: such activity in real accounts could elicit responses from account owners. Additionally, this limited our visibility on the attackers\' intentions, since we did not observe anything beyond the initial messages. In the future, it would be interesting to incorporate chatbots that will autorespond to messages; this will further deepen the impression of ""lived-in"" accounts (realism), but also has ethical implications.\n']",[],[],[],[],https://www.usenix.org//conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/onaolapo

Blind In On Path Attacks and Applications to VPNs,2021,USENIX Security,True,True,Internet and Network Security,none,"['Protecting network protocols within an encrypted tunnel, using technologies such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), is increasingly important to millions of users needing solutions to evade censorship or protect their traffic against in/onpath observers/attackers. In this paper, we present a series of attacks from two threat models: an attacker that can inject spoofed packets into the network stack of a VPN client (called client-side), and an attacker that can spoof packets on the Internet and send them to a VPN server (called server-side). In both cases, we assume that the attacker is in/on-path, and can count encrypted bytes or packets over time. In both threat models, we demonstrate attacks to infer the existence of, interfere with, or inject data into TCP connections forwarded through the encrypted VPN tunnel. In the server-side threat model, we also demonstrate an attack to hijack tunneled DNS queries and completely remove the protections of the VPN tunnel. For the attacks presented in this paper, we (1) assess their feasibility in terms of packet rates and timing; (2) test their applicability against a broad range of VPN technologies, types, and vendors; and (3) consider practical issues with respect to real-world attacks. We followed an ethical disclosure process for all attacks presented in this paper. Client-side attacks were addressed with two CVEs and partially mitigated by a series of updates from some operating system and VPN client vendors. Server-side attacks have not been addressed and are still feasible with all operating systems and VPN servers that we tested.\n', 'The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces our attack assumptions and discusses our ethical disclosure process. Section 3 provides background information on VPN technologies, source address validation at different levels of the Internet, and the TCP flags that are used in our attacks. Section 4 provides an overview of our threat model, and the different phases of our attack. In Section 5 we enumerate the experiments we carried out for different types of attacks. Section 6 presents our findings and analysis. Sections 7, 8, and 9 provide a discussion, related work, and conclusion, respectively.\n', 'For Experiment V, to illustrate what a real-world attack might look like, and the ways in which VPN security can be fundamentally undermined by blind in-path attacks, we developed a server-side attack that effectively removes all security and privacy properties of a VPN tunnel. In 2009, attackers in Iran with access to the national backbone obtained a valid TLS/SSL certificate for facebook.com and used man-in-themiddle attacks to steal Facebook passwords and view the Facebook activities of Iranian users. In this subsection we explore how that attack might have been carried out if Iranian users had had access to the latest version of WireGuard as of our experiment (version 1.0.20200827), which contains all patches WireGuard has released or intends to release based on our ethical disclosures. By tunneling all Internet traffic, including DNS requests and web traffic to/from Facebook, to a secure WireGuard VPN tunnel outside the country users should, in theory, have been protected from man-in-the-middle attacks in the backbone of the Iranian Internet. In this experiment we\n', 'For the client-side attack we tested it against a wide variety of operating systems and Android apps. See the artifact11. for a complete list of operating systems and vendors that we tested, all of which were vulnerable. Notably, we tested a variety of VPN-like technologies such as Orbot, Lantern, Psiphon, TunnelBear, and others that are not advertised as VPNs. Essentially, all Linux- and BSD-based12 operating systems were vulnerable before our ethical disclosure process, including Android and Apple devices. For client-side attacks, we only tested route-based VPNs (the vast majority of VPNs are route-based) and they were all vulnerable. We did not test policy-based VPNs, Windows OSes, or Tor [13] as part of Experiments VI and VII because we did not believe them to be vulnerable to the client-side attack due to separate network namespaces, the strong host model, and SOCKS interfaces being in user space, respectively. We later confirmed that these three OSes and apps are not vulnerable to the client-side attack.\n', '\x0ctacks, despite having ethically disclosed them to multiple OS and VPN vendors on August 13, 2020.

No cyber task performance or HSR information was provided back to any of the participants' employers.\n"", '2The IRB determined that the portion of the tasks that aligned with normal red team activity are not HSR and could be included in contracted work. The portion that collected data about the participants is HSR and was voluntary. Over 95% opted into the HSR portion of the study.\n', 'and realism. Participants were also given less time for this type of cyber task than they would take in a real-life scenario (over 50% indicated a week or more for typical engagement length [16]). Moreover, attackers\' behavior is likely to change if they face real consequences, with realistic motivation to avoid the deceptive elements. Additionally, while it is clear that red teamers are not the same population as unethical hackers, specific differences in their behaviors and reactions have not yet been well documented. Self-Report Data. Qualitative data adds a richness to quantitative metrics. As such, there are limitations in self-report data that may affect internal validity. Conclusions drawn from self-reported data were limited to what participants willingly transcribed, and do not tell a complete picture of a participant\'s frame of mind throughout the study. The variance in real-time reporting ranged from zero to 304 Mattermost messages in a day with 13% of participants providing zero. However, only 4% of participants skipped the of end-of-day report. While it\'s possible that personality differences could affect the quantity or quality, there were no detected differences across conditions in the conducted personality assessment [33]. Self-report data reflected the attacker\'s recollection and perception of their actions. Therefore, this data used in isolation is limited and may not represent the reality of tasks accomplished or actions taken. Low-Fidelity Decoys. The decoy-based deception evaluated in this research was non-interactive and non-exploitable. Comparable decoy systems, as well as higher fidelity, interactive, exploitable decoys are commercially available. We believe these higher fidelity decoys should be more difficult to identify and avoid, and can be fine-tuned to waste additional time and resources. Thus, they will have a greater effect on attacker behavior. This suggests our results may provide a lower baseline for the efficacy of decoy-based deception. A future study is needed to focus on these more sophisticated decoy systems. Nevertheless, in this study, only one expert participant (S116) correctly identified any of the low-fidelity decoys as deceptive machines. However, as noted above, the condensed time provided for the cyber task was unrealistic, so the ecological validity of this finding is limited. While Present-Informed Participant S116 had some successes identifying decoys, the cyberpscyhology methods were still effective, as evident by misidentification of several real machines as fake.

Weak Links in Authentication Chains A Large scale Analysis of Email Sender Spoofing Attacks,2021,USENIX Security,True,True,Attacks,none,"['In this work, we aim to summarize the potential email spoofing methods against the tested email services. Thus, we try to find out all verification issues from the four stages of the email transmission process mentioned in Section 2. Below, we first introduce the successful attacks from each stage separately. Then, we discuss our efforts to minimize the measurement bias and avoid ethical problems. The Successful Attacks. We consider an email spoofing attack successful if either of the following four conditions is satisfied. (1) In the email sending authentication stage, an attacker can modify the identifiers (e.g., Auth username/ MAIL From/ From) arbitrarily. (2) In the email receiving verification stage, the receiver\'s MTA gives a ""none/pass"" verification result even if the spoofed domain name has already deployed strict SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies. Since the verification results are not always shown in the email headers, we can infer the result by checking whether the email has entered the inbox as an alternative. Besides, we consider an attack failed if our spoofing email is dropped into the spam box, which means the receiver\'s MTA has detected the spoofing and taken defensive measures. To avoid accidental cases, we repeat each attack three times, ensuring that the spoofing email has actually penetrated the security protocols. Only the attacks that work all three times are regarded as successful attacks. (3) In the email forwarding stage, the forwarder gives a higher security endorsement to the forwarded email. Additionally, an attack is also considered successful if the attacker can freely configure forwarded emails to any accounts without any authentication verification. (4) In the email UI rendering stage, the displayed email address is inconsistent with the real one. In this stage, we use APPEND function of the IMAP [11] protocol to deliver the spoofing emails into the inbox, since we only need to check the UI rendering results rather than bypass the spam engine. Finally, we collect information and analyze the results depend on the webmail and email clients on the UI level. Minimize the Measurement Bias. First, to exclude the influence of the spam detection, we select the legitimate, benign and desensitized email samples provided by our industrial partner, a famous email provider, as the contents of our spoofing emails. These emails\' content is legal and harmless and can not be judged as spam. Second, all spoofing emails are sent from 15 IP addresses located in different regions with an interval of 10 minutes. Furthermore, we deploy MX/TXT/PTR records for the attacker\'s domain names and IP addresses. Third, to test how the receiver\'s MTA handles email with ""fail"" SPF/DMARC verification results, we reproduce the spoofing experiments in Hu\'s paper [20] on our target\n', '30 email services. We find that 23 of them reject the emails with ""fail"" SPF/DMARC verification results. The remaining ones mark them as spams. Besides, the results show that most of the vulnerabilities pointed in Hu\'s paper [20] have been fixed in the past two years. Ethics. We have taken active steps to ensure research ethics. Our measurement work only uses dedicated email accounts owned by ourselves. No real users are affected by our experiments. We have also carefully controlled the message sending rate with intervals over 10 minutes to minimize the impact on the target email services.\n']",[],[],[],[],https://www.usenix.org//conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/shen-kaiwen

However, they either can be circumvented by more advanced spoofers [21, 101] or are only applicable to limited domains such as airborne GPS receivers [104]. On the prevention side, cryptographic authentication based civilian GPS infrastructure can fundamentally prevent direct fabrications of GPS signals [101].

Shattered Chain of Trust Understanding Security Risks in Cross Cloud IoT Access Delegation,2020,USENIX Security,True,False,Embedded/IoT Security,none,"[""IoT clouds facilitate the communication between IoT devices and users, and authorize users' access to their devices. In this paradigm, an IoT device is usually managed under a particular IoT cloud designated by the device vendor, e.g., Philips bulbs are managed under Philips Hue cloud. Today's mainstream IoT clouds also support device access delegation across different vendors (e.g., Philips Hue, LIFX, etc.) and cloud providers (e.g., Google, IFTTT, etc.): for example, Philips Hue and SmartThings clouds support to delegate device access to another cloud such as Google Home, so a user can manage multiple devices from different vendors all through Google Home. Serving this purpose are the IoT delegation mechanisms developed and utilized by IoT clouds, which we found are heterogeneous and ad-hoc in the wild, in the absence of a standardized delegation protocol suited for IoT environments. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on real-world IoT access delegation, based upon a semi-automatic verification tool we developed. Our study brought to light the pervasiveness of security risks in these delegation mechanisms, allowing the adversary (e.g., Airbnb tenants, former employees) to gain unauthorized access to the victim's devices (e.g., smart locks) or impersonate the devices to trigger other devices. We confirmed the presence of critical security flaws in these mechanisms through end-to-end exploits on them, and further conducted a measurement study. Our research demonstrates the serious consequences of these exploits and the security implications of the practice today for building these mechanisms. We reported our findings to related parties, which acknowledged the problems. We further propose principles for developing more secure cross-cloud IoT delegation services, before a standardized solution can be widely deployed.\n"", ""The popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) gives rise to the demand for effectively managing these devices, which has been supported by IoT clouds. These clouds are operated by both device vendors (Philips Hue, LIFX, Tuya, etc.) and cloud providers (Google, Amazon, IFTTT, etc.), offering integrated services for IoT users to control their devices across the Internet in a convenient and transparent way. Prominent examples include SmartThings [33], IFTTT [13] and Google Home [12]. Such cloud services facilitate the communication between IoT devices and users, and manage users' access to the devices: IoT devices are registered to the clouds, and users' control commands (e.g., opening a lock, typically issued through the companion app of the device) go through the clouds' authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized users can operate a device. Today's IoT clouds tend to provide complicated functionalities like cross-vendor/crosscloud device control, sharing of device access, device control automation, etc., as enabled by the cloud's vast computing and communication resources. Of particular importance is the capability to delegate device access across different clouds and users: for example, Philips Hue may allow Google Home to control its smart light bulb, so the owner of the bulb can manage multiple devices from different vendors all through Google Home; an Airbnb host may temporarily give the access to the smart devices in her home to her guest during his stay. Such a capability can lead to a convoluted delegation chain, whose complicated authorization operations could easily go wrong. Although threats to IoT devices have been studied before [23, 52, 56, 57, 62, 76], little has been done so far to systematically analyze and understand the security implications of this IoT delegation process.\n"", ""Unaware of this side effect, Google discloses this ID to any client with the access right to the device, which brings in the security hazard. Specifically, on Google Home, as long as the administrator (e.g., an Airbnb host, a property manager) delegates a device's access right to a user once (e.g., an Airbnb guest, a tenant), the ID of the SmartThings device is permanently exposed. Even after the delegatee's access is revoked on Google Home (e.g., after he checks out of the Airbnb apartment), he still retains the capability to fake events of the device using the ID and triggers the administrator's other devices. Depending on the trigger-action rules configured by the owner/administrator, the fake events can open a smart lock (letting in an unauthorized individual), turn off an alarm, etc., through the SmartThings platform [10].\n"", ""PoC exploit on Flaw 1. Exploiting the above weakness, we implemented an end-to-end PoC attack on our own devices - an August smart lock and a SmartThings switch (a virtual switch that can be toggled in mobile app - not a physical switch). The experiment setting is outlined in Figure 2. Specifically, the victim set a trigger-action rule on the SmartThings cloud: if the switch is toggled, then lock/unlock the smart lock; also, she linked her SmartThings account to Google Home. Then through Google Home, she granted the access right of the switch to a malicious user (e.g., an ill-intentioned Airbnb guest). At this point, the attacker obtained the SmartThings device ID of the switch by inspecting the network traffic between his Google Home mobile app and the Google cloud. Later, the victim revoked the malicious user's access right and he could not control the device from his Google Home app. However, using a simple SmartApp of SmartThings (see our source code online [34]), which sends fake switch.off events to the SmartThings cloud with the switch's device ID, the attacker was able to open the smart lock.\n"", ""Since the IFTTT SmartApp runs on the SmartThings cloud and interacts with the end user, it is important to make sure that the SmartApp strictly follows SmartThings' security policies. Our research, however, shows that these policies have not been fully respected by the IFTTT SmartApp, possibly due to the lack of coordination between the two clouds. Specifically, we found that by calling an API provided by the IFTTT SmartApp, the SmartThings user can get the secret URL. This violates SmartThings' policy that allows a device administrator (e.g., an Airbnb host) to temporarily delegate the access right on her devices to a user (e.g., delegating the SmartThings switch to an Airbnb guest to operate the lock) and later revoke the right. That is, once the delegatee user acquires the URL, he retains a direct channel to communicate with the IFTTT device, even after the administrator revokes his access to the device on SmartThings: for example, through the URL, which serves as an authentication token, the user can send a fake event (e.g., switch is off) on behalf of the SmartThings device (e.g., the smart switch) so as to trigger the action on the IFTTT side (e.g., open the lock).\n"", ""As mentioned earlier (Section 3.1), on SmartThings, devices that the user can access and related SmartApps are grouped into a location, including devices behind the delegator clouds. In reality, however, a property manager or an Airbnb host (the administrator) may not want to give her tenant access to all her devices (e.g. the smart lock for the owner's room in a rented-out apartment). This is supported by the LIFX SmartApp in her location, which can be authorized to access all LIFX devices of the administrator (with the OAuth token issued by the LIFX cloud), and in the meantime can be configured to expose only a subset of the devices to the location. As a result, the delegatee user (e.g., the tenant) will only be able to use the subset of devices at the location he is given access to.\n"", ""Again, this weakness can be exploited in the real world, e.g., by a malicious Airbnb guest (or property tenant) to retain unauthorized device access. Specifically, the administrator on the Tuya cloud (e.g., an Airbnb host or property manager) delegates device access to the user, and later revokes the access through the Tuya cloud's management console. However, if the user has already strategically delegated his device access\n"", ""Discussion. This problem was first discovered through a manual check of the Tuya delegation process, which motivated this research. This case inspired us that the cross-cloud delegation in IoT can introduce new risks compared to traditional cross-website delegation scenarios, due to the different application paradigm and security requirements. For example, in a traditional scenario, when a user delegates access to her Facebook account to another Website via OAuth, her Facebook account would be almost impossible to be revoked by another party, and thus the need to invalidate the OAuth token following a revocation of the user's own Facebook access is less prominent. That is, delegation transitivity (see Section 2.3) is a less prominent security risk there. In contrast, delegating access to an untrusted user (e.g., an Airbnb guest or property tenant) and frequent access revocation in IoT context are commonplace. This requires IoT applications to appreciate delegation transitivity when applying OAuth, which, however, is less understood before.\n"", ""Philips Hue lets the device administrator (e.g., an Airbnb host or property manager) delegate device access to another Philips user (e.g., an Airbnb guest or property tenant). For example, Figure 6 shows that the delegatee user is given access to a Philips Hue bridge. Use of the Hue bridge can be done through the delegatee user's mobile app: (1) he first presses a physical button on the device (to enable a binding process); (2) the Philips app automatically fetches a secret token, called whitelistID, from the device through the local network they are all connected to; (3) the user then logs into his Philips app to obtain an OAuth token from the Philips cloud. With these two tokens, the user can issue commands to\n"", ""\x0cMiHome revokes the delegatee user's access, it invalids the token on the cloud, but does not inform the device to invalidate the secret string. Through our end-to-end experiment using our own device, we found this flaw introduces security risks in the real world scenario: even after the delegatee user's access is revoked (e.g., after an Airbnb guest checks out), as long as he can still connect to the local network where the device connects to (e.g., by going close to the Airbnb house), he can use the secret string as a token to command the device. Such a device under MiHome cloud can be a door lock, that can let the unauthorized user enter the house. Further, VerioT did not report any flaws on August or iHome clouds. However, their devices can be registered to SmartThings, and thereby potentially affected by Flaw 1.\n"", 'The risks reported in this paper affect scenarios of IoT access delegation, which are common today. For example, an Airbnb host often needs to delegate the access to her door locks to Airbnb guests (for them to access the property) and revoke the access later. Convenient delegation of (the access to) smart locks to Airbnb guests during their reservation period has been a prominent feature advocated by both Airbnb and mainstream IoT vendors [3, 4, 5], including lock manufacturers August, Remotelock and AURMUR, etc.\n', '[3] Airbnb API. https://www.airbnb.com/partner.

See No Evil Phishing for Permissions with False Transparency,2020,USENIX Security,True,True,"Phishing, Spam, and Threat Intelligence",approved,"[""Since our attack is a phishing attack at its core, it is important that it is persuasive to users. We speculate that users' comprehension of runtime permissions and their expectations from apps in this context will play a significant role in how users perceive our attack and impact its success. To this end, we performed a survey-based user study to quantify user behavior and used this quantification in order to guide the design of the attack and estimate its chances of success. Our findings suggest that Android users generally have a good understanding of the basics of the runtime permission model but appear confused about its intricate details. In particular, users demonstrate significant lack of appreciation of the critical security guarantees provided by runtime permissions. This leaves a sufficient gap in user understanding to enable an effective attack. In addition to the survey study, we conducted an inlab user study, which involved fewer users than the survey but provided a more realistic setting based on real devices and common daily tasks performed with popular apps. We provided each participant with an Android device on which we launched our attacks and found that none of the participants detected our attack.

iOS Your OS Everybody s OS Vetting and Analyzing Network Services of iOS Applications,2020,USENIX Security,True,True,Mobile 2 and Malware,none,"[""Based on the speed we tested for downloading the 1,300 seed apps, downloading 168,951 iOS apps in the wild with a single download task and an iOS jailbroken device is estimated to complete in 160 (assuming 24/7 activity) days. To achieve this efficiently in practice, we combine six downloading tasks with two jailbroken devices for app collection. To evade iTunes' detection of our automated downloader, two Apple accounts are iteratively used to download the .ipa files. This scheme enables us to collect 168,951 apps within just 30 days. Overall, our app collection can significantly improve the collection rate by 17 times faster in comparison to the methodology used by Yeonjoon et al. [62], which took three months to collect only 28,625 iOS apps. We highlight that not only the decrypting process can positively contribute to the speed-up of the app collection, but our headless-downloader can also fully utilize bandwidth for parallel apps download. In summary, the scalable app collection tool, developed in this paper, enables us to complete the collection of 168,951 iOS apps. Ethical considerations: We emphasize that routinely collecting and decrypting iOS apps using jailbroken iPhones is for the purpose of improving their service quality and security.

Liveness is Not Enough Enhancing Fingerprint Authentication with Behavioral Biometrics to Defeat Puppet Attacks,2020,USENIX Security,True,True,Authentication,approved,"[""Fingerprint authentication has gained increasing popularity on mobile devices in recent years. However, it is vulnerable to presentation attacks, which include that an attacker spoofs with an artificial replica. Many liveness detection solutions have been proposed to defeat such presentation attacks; however, they all fail to defend against a particular type of presentation attack, namely puppet attack, in which an attacker places an unwilling victim's finger on the fingerprint sensor. In this paper, we propose FINAUTH, an effective and efficient software-only solution, to complement fingerprint authentication by defeating both synthetic spoofs and puppet attacks using fingertip-touch characteristics. FINAUTH characterizes intrinsic fingertip-touch behaviors including the acceleration and the rotation angle of mobile devices when a legitimate user authenticates. FINAUTH only utilizes common sensors equipped on mobile devices and does not introduce extra usability burdens on users. To evaluate the effectiveness of FINAUTH, we carried out experiments on datasets collected from 90 subjects after the IRB approval. The results show that FINAUTH can achieve the average balanced accuracy of 96.04% with 5 training data points and 99.28% with 100 training data points. Security experiments also demonstrate that FINAUTH is resilient against possible attacks. In addition, we report the usability analysis results of FINAUTH, including user authentication delay and overhead.\n"", 'After receiving the IRB approval from our university in June 2018, we started recruiting subjects for the data collection, which lasted for 5 months.

This is a very challenging problem, because some of these security and privacy features are inherently dual use: for example, admin roles and access controls may desirable for parents to prevent children from doing harmful things, but could be used by abusers to exercise power over their victims.

Users Really Do Answer Telephone Scams,2019,USENIX Security,True,True,Phishing and Scams,approved,"['In this paper, we present the methodology, design, execution, results, and evaluation of an ethical telephone phishing scam. The study performed 10 telephone phishing experiments on 3,000 university participants without prior awareness over the course of a workweek. Overall, we were able to identify at least one key factor--spoofed Caller ID--that had a significant effect in tricking the victims into revealing their Social Security number.\n', 'The goal of the study is to design a systematic approach that can reveal the effective factors in telephone scams by conducting our own telephone phishing scam. Our approach to designing the study is to first identify the attributes that could lead to an effective telephone phishing scam. After that, we design a set of experiments and procedures that allow comparison of different variations of an attribute. Each experiment followed a standardized procedure that was conducted on each group simultaneously (all calls were distributed in a randomized order throughout the experiment). Finally, we provide a discussion on what could be learned from the analysis and provide our recommended solutions for combating the telephone phishing problem. The study was conducted with significant ethical consideration and with IRB approval (see Section 3.5 for an in-depth discussion of ethics).\n', ""Caller Name: Today, most telephone terminals have the capability of associating a name with a telephone number. With a stored contact, an incoming call from the stored contact would show the name associated with the caller ID. To perform a spear phishing attack [21, 22], a malicious caller could spoof the caller ID of a known stored contact. A known stored contact can be identified for an organization by studying the publicly available phone numbers or for an individual by manually analyzing social network information. For legal, ethical, and IRB approval reasons, we did not actually spoof a known caller name. Instead, we asked our telephone service department to temporarily create a new contact in the university's internal phone directory and associated a legitimate sounding name with the telephone number. We used that telephone number in our scam experiments to produce a similar effect to caller name spoofing. Voice Production: According to reports of real-world telephone scams, some used a robotic (synthesized) voice, while others used a pre-recorded human voice [20, 23]. To test the effect of synthesized voices vs. human voices, we recreated known scams using a text-to-speech synthesizer to generate a speech similar to the real-world scams. To mimic the human voice version of the scams, we recorded human voices speaking the exact same announcement message. Gender: From listening to recordings of actual telephone scams, some used a male voice, and some used a female voice. To test if the vocal gender of the voice could have an effect on the telephone scam, we varied the voice gender between male and female in the text-to-speech synthesizer. Accent: From the reports of telephone scams, some spoke with an Indian accent, and some others spoke with an American accent. It seems possible that recipients would be more wary of scams that speak in a foreign accent, and would be less suspicious of scams that speak in an American accent. To test if this could have an effect on the telephone scam, we varied the recorded voice accent between Indian and American in our experiments. Entity: From gathering real-world telephone scams, two types of scams stood out in terms of the number of reports: IRS impersonation scams [24] and HR impersonation scams [25]. In these scams, the scammer claimed to be from the IRS or the company's HR department. While the IRS scams can affect any taxpayer in the US, the HR scams are usually targeted toward people in a specific company. Intuitively, it seems that a more targeted attack would have more success. Thus, we varied the impersonated entity of our scams between the IRS and ASU's HR department1. To simulate the real-world HR scams as closely as possible, we initially wanted to impersonate our university's HR department. However, our HR department had strong objections about using their name to conduct the scam experiments. As a compromise, our experiments claimed to be from a fake\n"", ""To comply with legal requirements [26], our own ethical considerations, and our IRB (Section 3.5), we conducted experiments on our university's internal population (rather than the general population). This population was unaware of our study (and we discuss the ethical implications of this deceptive non-consent study in Section 3.5). The population of the\n"", 'Reearcher contact info and IRB statement\n', 'procedure also must be carried out ethically and minimize potential harm to the participants.\n', 'For Experiment 9, the incoming call screen also shows a caller name as shown in Figure 2b. This experiment was designed to simulate a scammer spoofing a known caller name. For legal and ethical reasons, we did not actually spoof a phone number. Instead, we asked our telephone service department to temporarily create a new contact in the university\'s internal phone directory and associated a legitimate sounding HR department name ""W-2 Administration"" with the telephone number. In a normal external call, there is no caller ID displayed, however, IT was able to help us create the caller ID shown in Figure 2b. While a scammer would not be able to create a new name, they can spoof the caller ID of a known caller with a targeted spearphishing scam.\n', ""In the real world, the last four digits of the Social Security number can be used to perpetrate financial and identity fraud [27]. Other parts of the Social Security number can also be inferred from the recipient's phone number [28]. To minimize potential risk to the recipient (with cooperation and consultation with our IRB), we did not record which digits were pressed, we instead recorded only if any digit was pressed.\n"", '3.5 Ethics\n', ""These experiments were a deceptive study on involuntary participants, and therefore we deeply considered the ethical issues. To address the ethical issues inherent in our experiments, we carefully designed the experiments and worked with our university's IRB, to not simply obtain approval but to conduct the study minimizing harm. This is important because, to have scientifically valid results, we could not obtain informed consent (this would bias the results of the study) and we must deceive the participants (they would need to believe that the call was an actual scam call). To protect our participants, we implemented several safeguards in the experimental design.\n"", 'In recording the results, we also strove to do so ethically and in accordance with established IRB protocols. One of the major safeguards is that we did not record the Social Security number. While a spammer would typically want the Social Security number, all that we record is the fact that they pressed any digit. In fact, we did not even ask for the full Social Security number, and we performed no analysis to see if they provided nonsensical last four Social Security numbers. This has the drawback of decreasing the validity of our data--participants may have felt safe to input only the last four of their Social Security number (when they would not input the full number) or they input fake last four digits of their Social Security number. Although these measures may diminish the strength of our data, we believe ethics is a more important aspect of designing a telephone phishing study.\n', 'The IRB office also received some complaints (we were not told exactly how many) regarding the scam call experiments, which resulted in our experiments being paused for roughly 12 hours (start to finish) starting on day 2, as we waited for the IRB committee to review the complaints. The IRB examined our procedures and decided that, as our study was originally designed, the beneficence outweighed the harm (as evidenced by the complaints) and allowed the study to proceed.\n', 'Thank you.

However, the ethical intentions of both participants are not always clear. For instance, a honeypot creator might deploy a honeypot with the intention to scam users and make profit. In this case we clearly have a malicious intention. However, one could also argue that a honeypot creator is just attempting to punish users that behave maliciously. Similarly, the intentions of a honeypot user can either be malicious or benign. For example, if a user tries to intentionally exploit a reentrancy vulnerability, then he or she needs to be knowledgable and mischievous enough to prepare and attempt the attack, and thus clearly showing malicious behaviour. However, if we take the example of an uninitialised struct honeypot that is disguised as a simple lottery, then we might have the case of a benign user who loses his funds under the assumption that he or she is participating in a fair lottery. Thus, both honeypot creators and users cannot always be clearly classified as either malicious or benign, this depends on the case at hand. Nevertheless, we are aware that our methodology may serve malicious attackers to protect themselves from other malicious attackers.

We will leave this as our future work. Ethical issue. Our research only involved analysis of preexisting code and app content and did not collect new data during the study. Therefore, it is just a secondary analysis of already published materials, which does not constitute humansubject research. Another ethical concern comes from the potential that Cruiser could be used to identify possible benign hidden UIs; e.g., for censorship circumvention. Here we clarify that Cruiser is just a methodology for discovery and understanding of a new type of cybercrime, and during our study, we did not observe any such censorship evasion attempts. We acknowledge that any evasion detection techniques, including ours, could also be used for censorship. In the meantime, our methodology has been tailored towards crowdturfing detection: e.g., the features used by the structure miner are based upon the structures of real-world crowdturfing apps, the Word2vec model and other NLP components are all built on crowdturfing data.

In the context of social media, user activity, consumption behaviour, and clicking norms in the social network were found to be important factors for phishing success [40]. As opposed to focusing on the characteristics of the individuals that receive the phishing (as this information for the population of customers is generally unknown to organizations, or may be impossible to collect due to legal and ethical challenges), in this work we consider the expected aggregate responses of the phishing recipients as a function of the phishing emails.\n', ""Data limitations and ethical aspects. From the data structure, the link between a clicked URL and the specific email from which that click originated is not explicit and can only be reconstructed by exact match of the destination URL. This has the effect of limiting the scope of this study to the comparison of the effectiveness of cognitive influence techniques between phishing emails that are likely to have generated the click (as we cannot fully reproduce the process generating the detection of URLs that could have been clicked, but have not). This also limits the number of matches between URLs reported in event alerts and URLs linked in emails. Further, the results of this work are limited to the emails that have been reported (and therefore identified at least once) by Org's customers. Despite the large number of active reporting customers, particularly well-crafted emails may not be represented in our dataset. Further, we can only observe data captured by the User Session Monitoring System, i.e. related to emails pointing to domains that `call back' to Org's systems.

We conduct some measurement experiments on Tor to better understand its composition and performance characteristics. However, we neither observe nor store any information about any Tor users (other than ourselves). We evaluate our attacks using high-fidelity Shadow simulations that are constructed to resemble the live Tor network.

However, while no simulator is perfect, Shadow has been shown to exhibit network behavior and performance that is very similar to Linux [50, 52]. Additionally, Shadow has been used to measure performance when Tor is generally overloaded (as in our evaluation) [47, 49, 52], and it has been used to measure the effects of specific DoS attacks against Tor [51].\n', 'Our experiments are limited in scale. We simulated a private Tor network with about 10% of both the number of relays in and the bandwidth capacity of the public Tor network. The cost to the adversary to conduct our attack may not scale linearly with the amount of Tor capacity as we assumed in §7.4, or there may be other issues that arise when scaling up our attack. We note that we are limited by the capabilities of our tools and resources and highlight that it would be unethical to conduct this work at scale on the public Tor network. Attack Extensions: We did not evaluate the effects of onion connection tunneling on DoS (i) because Tor could prevent the attack by updating the default exit policy to prevent exiting to a Tor relay, and (ii) in order to provide a more conservative estimate of the bandwidth and monetary costs of performing our bandwidth DoS attack. However, we believe that the technique would be simple to deploy.

The data collected did not contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and was securely stored and accessible only to authorized researchers. We recruited study participants via local mailing lists, Craigslist, Twitter, and local groups on Facebook. We compensated them with a $5 gift card.

Before starting the study, participants had to sign our consent form and complete an entry survey containing demographic questions. We made sure to get a wide diversity of subjects, both in terms of age and experience with technology (details available in Appendix A). For all the experiments, we configured the test environment on LG Google Nexus 5X phones running the Android 7.1 Nougat OS. We used a background service, automatically relaunched at boot time, to log participants' responses to system messages and alerts, input events generated by participants while interacting with the testing programs, as well as system events and inter-process communications between programs. Furthermore, during the experiments, the researchers took note of comments made by participants to ease the analysis of user decision making.\n"", 'framework. The loaner device had pre-installed 5 voice assistants and 10 apps selected among the most popular6 with up to millions of downloads from the official Google Play store. For such programs, to ensure the confidentiality of participants\' personal information, mock accounts were set up instead of real accounts for all apps requiring a log-in. To facilitate daily use of the loaner device, the researcher transferred participants\' SIM cards and data, as well as participants\' apps in the loaner device, however no data was collected from such apps. The above protocol was a requirement for the IRB approval by our Institution and it is compliant with the protocol followed in related work [33, 15, 11]. Before loaning the device, the researcher asked each participant to use the loaner device for their everyday tasks for a period of 7 days. In addition to their everyday tasks, participants were asked to explore each of the preinstalled voice assistants and apps, at least once a day, by interacting as they would normally do. Particularly, we asked the participants to interact with each voice assistant by asking the following three questions: (1) ""capture a screenshot,"" (2) ""record a voice note,"" (3) ""how long does it take to drive back home."" Additionally, we asked participants to be creative and ask three additional questions of their choice. Table 2 summarizes all the assistants and apps pre-installed on the smartphones for the field study.

Wireless Attacks on Aircraft Instrument Landing Systems,2019,USENIX Security,True,True,"Planes, Cars, and Robots",approved,"[""and efficient operation. For instance, air traffic controllers verbally communicate with the pilots over the VHF (30 to 300 MHz) radio frequency channels. The airplanes continuously broadcast their position, velocity, callsigns, altitude, etc. using the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADSB) wireless communication protocol. Primary and secondary surveillance radars enable aircraft localization and provide relevant target information to the air traffic controllers. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), an airborne wireless system independent of the air traffic controller enables the aircraft to detect potential collisions and alert the pilots. Air traffic information, flight information and other operational control messages between the aircraft and ground stations are transferred using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) which uses the VHF and HF radio frequency channels for communication. Similarly, many radio navigation aids such as GPS, VHF Omnidirectional Radio Range (VOR), Non-directional radio beacons (NDB), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and Instrument Landing System (ILS) play crucial roles during different phases of an airplane's flight.\n"", ""with aviation experts. Since we use an FAA accredited flight simulator, we sent our configuration files and scripts to a licensed pilot for them to perform final approaches using the instruments and give us feedback. We were mainly concerned whether there was any other indicator on the cockpit that raises suspicion about the attack. We conducted our attack evaluations in both wired and controlled wireless settings. Note that it is illegal to transmit ILS signals over the air in a public space. Effects due to aircraft's motion such as Doppler shift do not affect the attacker signal as these are receiver end problems and the receiver hardware already accounts for such effects for the legitimate signal. Note that the attacker closely imitates the legitimate signals in frequency and amplitude. In short, we made the best effort to replicate a real-world approach. However our setup has its limitations. We did not perform the experiments on a real aircraft which would give us more insights on the effects of aircraft's construction, antenna placements, cockpit display sensitivity, etc. One of the factors that will get affected is the power required by the attacker. Note that commercial ILS transmitters use a 25 watts transmitter for localizer signals and a 5 W power for the glideslope signals. To put things in perspective, a standard 12 V 10 Ah battery can power a 24 Watts amplifier for about 5 hours. Furthermore, we are in touch with a leading aircraft manufacturer for access to such an experiment. We also note that we are in the process of acquiring IRB approval to recruit commercial pilots and studying their response to the attack proposed in this paper.\n"", '[10] Yaesu FTA-750L, 2012. https://www.yaesu.com/ airband/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts& DivisionID=2&ProdCatID=204&ProdID=1777.\n']",[],[],[],[],https://www.usenix.org//conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/sathaye

All Your Clicks Belong to Me Investigating Click Interception on the Web,2019,USENIX Security,True,False,Web Attacks,none,"['Click Fraud and Click Spam. Click fraud and click spam are attempts to raise revenue by submitting fake ad clicks to an ad network. In traditional click fraud, attackers usually operate a botnet to fabricate a large number of ad clicks automatically to an ad network. For example, Pearce et al. [27] estimated that the ZeroAccess click-fraud botnet incurred advertising losses on the order of $100,000 per day. In click spam, unethical content publishers or ad injection attackers [32, 37] either trick the users into clicking ads, or use malware to click ads on behalf of the users. Click spams could even lead victim users to malicious ads [16, 37, 39]. Defenses against click fraud and click spam mostly aim to distinguish fake clicks from real clicks by analyzing their patterns [5, 6, 12, 17, 21, 22, 38]. Thus, attackers try to make their click traffic look as benign as possible. For example, some attacks hijack real human clicks through rogue DNS servers and redirect them to ad networks [2]. We discover that the click interception techniques we identify have already been used by attackers for generating realistic click traffic in the wild.\n']",[],[],[],[],https://www.usenix.org//conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/zhang

Bamboozling Certificate Authorities with BGP,2018,USENIX Security,True,True,TLS and PKI,none,"[""The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) protects users from malicious man-in-the-middle attacks by having trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) vouch for the domain names of servers on the Internet through digitally signed certificates. Ironically, the mechanism CAs use to issue certificates is itself vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks by network-level adversaries. Autonomous Systems (ASes) can exploit vulnerabilities in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to hijack traffic destined to a victim's domain. In this paper, we rigorously analyze attacks that an adversary can use to obtain a bogus certificate. We perform the first real-world demonstration of BGP attacks to obtain bogus certificates from top CAs in an ethical manner. To assess the vulnerability of the PKI, we collect a dataset of 1.8 million certificates and find that an adversary would be capable of gaining a bogus certificate for the vast majority of domains. Finally, we propose and evaluate two countermeasures to secure the PKI: 1) CAs verifying domains from multiple vantage points to make it harder to launch a successful attack, and 2) a BGP monitoring system for CAs to detect suspicious BGP routes and delay certificate issuance to give network operators time to react to BGP attacks.\n"", 'In this paper, we first analyze and compare BGP attacks on the domain verification process to develop a taxonomy and present a highly effective use of the ""AS-path poisoning"" attack originally performed in [39]. Next, we launch all the BGP attacks against our own domain and decrypt seemingly ""secure"" HTTPS traffic within seconds. To avoid harming real users, these attacks were done in an ethical manner on domains that resolve into our own IP prefix and were registered solely for the purpose of the experiments. We then quantify the vulnerability of domain verification to these attacks. Finally, we propose countermeasures against these attacks.

Who Is Answering My Queries Understanding and Characterizing Interception of the DNS Resolution Path,2018,USENIX Security,True,True,Web and Network Measurement,none,"[""The purposes of DNS interception include displaying advertisements (e.g., through manipulation of NXDOMAIN responses [56]), collecting statistics, and blocking malware connections, to name a few. However, such practices can raise multiple concerns: (1) The interception is not authorized by users and is difficult to detect on the users' side, which leads to ethical concerns; (2) Users have higher risks to put the resolution trust to alternative recursive DNS servers, which often lack proper maintenance (e.g., equipped with outdated DNS software), compared to well-known public DNS servers; (3) Certain security-related functionalities are affected or even broken, e.g., some alternative DNS resolvers do not provide DNSSEC.\n"", 'In this section, we describe the methodology and data collection of our study, which try to address the two major challenges described in Section 1. We begin by describing the high-level idea of our approach and the design requirements it needs to meet. Then, we elaborate the details of each component of our measurement framework and how we obtain a large volume of globally distributed vantage points. Finally, ethical concerns regarding our data collection are discussed.\n', ""The major concerns of this experiment are around ethics and privacy, and we carefully address these concerns as briefly described below (more details are covered in Section 3.5). Firstly, the module where we implement our measurement script (sending and receiving DNS packets) comes with a consent, and the software has to be run manually with granted permission from users. Secondly, although sending diverse DNS requests from a client helps us comprehensively understand DNSIntercept characteristics, we try to avoid generating excessive traffic on user's devices. This choice limits the diversity of our DNS requests. Finally, our script only captures DNS packets of domains exclusively registered for this study, thus the data deemed private, like requests to social networks, is not collected. Distribution of DNS packets. According to our inception model described earlier, to generate as diverse DNS packets as possible, we should launch DNS requests from a client under all four different SLDs, of all five RR types, over both TCP and UDP, and to all four public DNS services. However, we believe it is difficult due to ethical concerns and limitations of vantage points.\n"", '3.5 Ethics\n', 'Our methodology could introduce a few ethical concerns. Here, we discuss them before presenting our results. Throughout this study, we take utmost care to protect users from side-effects that may be caused by our experiment.\n', 'In China-wide analysis, we implement our measurement script in a network debugger module of security software with millions of users. To avoid ethical concerns, this network debugger module comes with a onetime consent stating its procedure and data collected. Users reserve the right of choosing whether to install this security software and whether to run this module containing our measurement script manually. In addition, the user has the option to install the software without the measurement module.\n', ""In our experiment setup, we launch DNS packets with diverse field values from our clients to public DNS services. On the whole, by comparing the interception ratio of packets of different field values, we first investigate what kinds of packets are more likely to be intercepted. Table 5 presents our summary of results in this phase. Transport protocol. Compared to those over TCP, DNS requests over UDP from clients are more likely to be intercepted. For instance, 27.9% DNS requests sent to Google Public DNS over UDP are redirected or replicated, the ratio being only 7.3% when it is through TCP. In fact, most of DNS requests in the real world are over UDP, and intercepting UDP traffic is technically easier. Therefore, it is reasonable for UDP traffic to be primarily intercepted. Targeted public DNS services. DNSIntercept targets DNS traffic sent to not only renowned public DNS services but also less prevalent ones. Similar to our findings of Global analysis, the interception ratio for renowned public resolvers is significantly higher. For instance, 27.9% UDP-based DNS packets sent to Google are intercepted, the ratio being 9.8% for our in-house EDU DNS. DNS RR Types. We find that A-type requests are slightly preferred to be intercepted, possibly because it's the most common RR type. Meanwhile, we notice in Table 5 that for Request replication, clients receive no in-band responses of CNAME, NS or MX-type requests. We speculate that on-path devices, while replicating requests, block responses of the three RR types from public DNS services, reiterating the unethical nature of the interception behavior. TLD of requested domain. Due to the extra time overhead introduced by inspecting requested domain names, it is unlikely that on-path devices specify certain domains and merely intercept requests of them. Shown in Table 6, the ratio of intercepted DNS requests does not change much for domains under different TLDs. Case Study. In total, we find 61 ASes out of 356 (17.13%) are problematic. In Table 7, we list the top five ASes from which most DNS requests (292K in total) are sent by the client. As our clients are mainly from China, the top 5 ASes belong to three largest Chinese ISPs. We find that ASes of China Mobile have significantly higher interception ratio than ASes of other Chinese ISPs. Regarding alternative resolvers, they are mostly locating in the same AS as their clients. However, we find that they may also locate in a different AS of the same ISP (e.g., AS56046 in Table 7).\n"", ""\x0ccal DNS servers rather than untrusted ones outside the local network, hence are less likely to be hijacked [24, 26]. However, first of all, for clients who trust public DNS services and designate them to handle DNS requests, DNSIntercept certainly brings ethical issues and violates the trust relationship between users and their preferred DNS resolvers. Besides, our measurement results show that the interception ratio of public DNS services, which are of good reputation and security deployment, is significantly higher than that of less-known public services. This conclusion conflicts with improving DNS security using DNSIntercept, since out-of-band public DNS services are not treated equally as untrusted resolvers. What's worse, while rare, we do observe hijacking behaviors for profit (e.g., traffic monetization). Improving performance of DNS lookups. Another claimed motivation of DNSIntercept is to improve the performance of DNS lookups and user experience. As discussed in Section 5.2, we find that Request replication does shorten the RTT of DNS lookups, while the influence of Request redirection is uncertain. However, in practice, for top 5 ASes shown in Table 7, the ratio of Request redirection, which brings uncertain rather than probable improvement of performance, is significantly higher. Therefore, DNSIntercept only brings limited improvement to DNS lookup performance. Reducing financial settlement. ISPs, especially those of a small scale, would like to reduce their cost of traffic exchange among networks. Request redirection satisfies the need of reducing out-of-band traffic, thus is witnessed in some ASes as shown in Table 7. Therefore, we suppose the financial issue to be a major motivation of DNSIntercept. After an offline meeting with the DNS management team of one large Chinese ISP, this motivation is confirmed.\n"", 'With good reputation and availability, well-known public DNS services are widely trusted by Internet users and applications. Unfortunately, our study shows that the trust can be violated by DNSIntercept. We further discuss the potential threats and security concerns introduced by DNSIntercept. Ethics and privacy. DNSIntercept is difficult to detect at client side, thus Internet users might not realize their traffic is intercepted. Firstly, when DNS requests from clients are handled by alternative resolvers, previous studies have proved it is possible to illegally monetize from traffic [36, 56]. Secondly, as it is difficult for Internet users to detect DNSIntercept merely from clients, public DNS resolvers can be wrongly blamed when undesired results (e.g., advertisement sites or even malware) are returned [36]. Finally, it is possible for intercepted DNS requests to be snooped by untrusted third parties, leading to the leak of privacy data. Therefore, we believe DNSIntercept potentially brings ethical and privacy risks to Internet users. DNS security practices. While popular public DNS servers are often deployed with full DNSSEC support and up-to-date DNS software, a number of nameservers and resolvers in the wild are still using outdated or even deprecated DNS software, which may be vulnerable to known attacks [42, 54], and DNSSEC deployment on resolvers is still poor. We provide a cursory view of security practices of 1,166 alternative DNS resolvers that contact our authoritative nameservers; 205 of them are open to the public. Although these resolvers might not be broadly representative, they still provide us with an opportunity to understand DNS security practices. Among the 205 public alternative resolvers, only 88 (43%) accept DNSSEC requests; those actually validating DNSSEC requests could be less. After fingerprinting the DNS software deployed on the resolvers using fpdns [11], we find 97 (47%) are running BIND. Unfortunately, the fingerprint shows that all 97 servers use versions earlier than 9.4.0, which ought to be deprecated before 2009. Therefore, according to the public vulnerability repository [6], all of them are vulnerable to known attacks like DoS. DNS functionalities. Besides DNSSEC, other functionalities of DNS can be affected by DNSIntercept, if al-\n']",[],[],[],[],https://www.usenix.org//conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/liu-baojun

Global Measurement of DNS Manipulation,2017,USENIX Security,True,True,Censorship,none,"['Despite the pervasive nature of Internet censorship and the continuous evolution of how and where censorship is applied, measurements of censorship remain comparatively sparse. Understanding the scope, scale, and evolution of Internet censorship requires global measurements, performed at regular intervals. Unfortunately, the state of the art relies on techniques that, by and large, require users to directly participate in gathering these measurements, drastically limiting their coverage and inhibiting regular data collection. To facilitate large-scale measurements that can fill this gap in understanding, we develop Iris, a scalable, accurate, and ethical method to measure global manipulation of DNS resolutions. Iris reveals widespread DNS manipulation of many domain names; our findings both confirm anecdotal or limited results from previous work and reveal new patterns in DNS manipulation.\n', 'In addition to achieving accurate results, another significant design challenge concerns ethics. In contrast to systems that explicitly involve volunteers in collecting measurements, methods that send DNS queries through open DNS resolvers deployed across the Internet raise the issue of potentially implicating third parties who did not in fact agree to participate in the measurement. Using ""open resolvers"" is potentially problematic, as most of these are not actual resolvers but instead DNS forwarders in home routers and other devices [46]. A censor may misattribute requests from these resources as individual citizens attempting to access censored resources.\n', 'Our work makes the following contributions. First, we design, implement, and deploy Iris, a scalable, ethical system for measuring DNS manipulation. Second, we develop analysis metrics for disambiguating natural variation in DNS responses for a domain from nefarious manipulation. Third, we perform a global measurement study that highlights the heterogeneity of DNS manipulation, across countries, resolvers, and domains. We find that manipulation varies across DNS resolvers even within a single country.\n', 'We tried to use their method for conducting global measurements specifically for detecting censorship. However, censorship detection was not a focus of their work, and the paper does not explicitly describe the details of its detection process. In particular, other than examining HTTP pages for ""blocked by the order of . . . "" phrasing, the paper does not present a decision process for determining whether a given instance of apparent manipulation reflects censorship or some other phenomenon. In addition, their measurements leverage open resolvers en masse, which raises ethical concerns for end users who may be wrongly implicated for attempting to access banned content. In contrast, we frame an explicit, reproducible method for globally measuring DNS-based manipulation in an ethically responsible manner.\n', 'In this section we describe Iris, a scalable, lightweight system to detect DNS manipulation. We begin by scoping the problem space, identifying the capabilities and limitations of various measurement building blocks, and stating our assumptions about the threat model. We explain the process by which we select (1) which domain names to measure, and (2) the vantage points to measure them from, taking into consideration questions of ethics and scalability. We then describe, given a set of measurement vantage points and DNS domain names, how we characterize the results of our measurements and use them to draw conclusions about whether DNS manipulation is taking place, based on either the consistency or the independent verifiability of the responses that we receive. Next, we consider our technical approach in light of existing ethical norms and guidelines, and explain how various design decisions help us adhere to those principles as much as possible. Finally, we discuss the implicit and technical limitations of Iris.\n', 'Approach. Detecting DNS manipulation is conceptually simple: At a high-level, the idea entails performing DNS queries through geographically distributed DNS resolvers and analyzing the responses for activity that suggests that the responses for a DNS domain might be manipulated. Despite its apparent simplicity, however, realizing a system to scalably collect DNS data and analyze it for manipulation poses both ethical and technical challenges. The ethical challenges concern selecting DNS resolvers that do not implicate innocent citizens, as well as ensuring that Iris does not induce undue load on the DNS resolution infrastructure; §3.2 explains the ethical guidelines we use to reason about design choices. §3.3 describes how Iris selects a ""safe"" set of open DNS resolvers; The technical challenges center around developing sound methods for detecting manipulation, which we describe in §3.4 and §3.5.\n', '3.2 Ethics\n', 'The design of Iris incorporates many considerations regarding ethics. Our primary ethical concern is the risks associated with the measurements that Iris conducts, as issuing DNS queries for potentially censored or manipulated DNS domains through resolvers that we do not own could potentially implicate otherwise innocent users. A second concern is whether the DNS queries that we generate introduce undue query load on authoritative DNS nameservers for domains that we do not own. With these concerns in mind, we consider the ethics of performing measurements with Iris, using the ethical guidelines of the Belmont Report [10] and Menlo Report [20] to frame our discussion.\n', 'One important ethical principle is respect for persons; essentially, this principle states that an experiment should respect the rights of humans as autonomous decisionmakers. Sometimes this principle is misconstrued as a requirement for informed consent for all experiments. In many cases, however, informed consent is neither practical nor necessary; accordingly, Salganik [44] characterizes this principle instead as ""some consent for most things"". In the case of Iris, obtaining the consent of all open DNS resolver operators is impractical.\n', ""In lieu of attempting to obtain informed consent, we turn to the principle of beneficence, which weighs the benefits of conducting an experiment against the risks associated with the experiment. Note that the goal of beneficence is not to eliminate risk, but merely to reduce it to the extent possible. Iris's design relies heavily on this principle: Specifically, we note that the benefit of issuing DNS queries through tens of millions of resolvers has rapidly diminishing returns, and that using only open resolvers that we can determine are unlikely to correspond to individual users greatly reduces the risk to any individual without dramatically reducing the benefits of our experiment. We note that our consideration of ethics in this regard is a significant departure from previous work that has issued queries through open DNS resolver infrastructure but has not considered ethics.\n"", 'Measurement using open DNS resolvers is an ethically complex issue. Previous work has identified tens of millions of these resolvers around the world [34]. Given their prevalence and global diversity, open resolvers are a compelling resource, providing researchers with considerable volume and reach. Unfortunately, open resolvers also pose a risk not only to the Internet but to individual users.\n', 'Due to these and the ethics considerations that we discussed in §3.2, we restrict the set of open resolvers that we use to the few thousand resolvers that we are reasonably certain are part of the Internet infrastructure (e.g., belonging to Internet service providers, online cloud hosting providers), as opposed to attributable to any single individual. Figure 1 illustrates the process by which Iris finds safe open DNS resolvers. We now explain this process in more detail. Conceptually, the process comprises two steps: (1) scanning the Internet for open DNS resolvers; or (2) pruning the list of open DNS resolvers that we identify to limit the resolvers to a set that we can reasonably attribute to Internet infrastructure.\n', 'All Usable Ethically Usable Experiment Set\n', 'All Usable Ethically Usable Experiment Set\n', 'The degree to which we can investigate DNS manipulation across various countries depends on the geographic distribution of the selected DNS resolvers. By geolocating this initial set of resolvers using Censys [21] and MaxMind [37], we observed that these resolvers reside in 232 countries and dependent territories2, with a median of 659 resolvers per country. Due to the ethical considerations we outlined in §3.2, we restrict this set of resolvers to 6,564 infrastructure resolvers, in 157 countries, again with a median of 6 resolvers per country. Finally, we remove unstable or otherwise anomalous resolvers; §4.3 describes this process in more detail. This filtering reduces the set of usable resolvers to 6,020 in 151 countries, with a median of 6 resolvers in each. Table 1 summarizes the resulting population of resolvers; Table 2 shows the breakdown across continents. We also use 4 geographically diverse resolvers for controlled experiments; the 2 Google Public DNS servers [28], a German open resolver hosted on Amazon AWS, and a resolver that we manage at the University of California, Berkeley.\n', 'The major contributions of our work are: (1) Iris: a scalable, ethical system for measuring DNS manipulation; (2) an analysis technique for disambiguating natural variation in DNS responses (e.g., due to CDNs) from more nefarious types of manipulation; and (3) a largescale measurement study that highlights the heterogeneity of DNS manipulation, across countries, resolvers, and domains. Notably, we find that manipulation is heterogeneous across DNS resolvers even within a single country. Iris supports regular, continuous measurement, which will ultimately facilitate tracking DNS manipulation trends as they evolve over time; our next step is to operationalize such measurements to facilitate longitudinal analysis.\n', '[10] The Belmont Report - Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research. http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/ guidelines/belmont.html.\n', '[20] D.

Exploring User Perceptions of Discrimination in Online Targeted Advertising,2017,USENIX Security,True,True,Web Security,approved,"[""Targeted online advertising now accounts for the largest share of the advertising market, beating out both TV and print ads. While targeted advertising can improve users' online shopping experiences, it can also have negative effects. A plethora of recent work has found evidence that in some cases, ads may be discriminatory, leading certain groups of users to see better offers (e.g., job ads) based on personal characteristics such as gender. To develop policies around advertising and guide advertisers in making ethical decisions, one thing we must better understand is what concerns users and why. In an effort to answer this question, we conducted a pilot study and a multi-step main survey (n=2,086 in total) presenting users with different discriminatory advertising scenarios. We find that overall, 44% of respondents were moderately or very concerned by the scenarios we presented. Respondents found the scenarios significantly more problematic when discrimination took place as a result of explicit demographic targeting rather than in response to online behavior. However, our respondents' opinions did not vary based on whether a human or an algorithm was responsible for the discrimination. These findings suggest that future policy documents should explicitly address discrimination in targeted advertising, no matter its origin, as a significant user concern, and that corporate responses that blame the algorithmic nature of the ad ecosystem may not be helpful for addressing public concerns.\n"", 'In our main survey (n=891), a large portion (44%) of respondents viewed our scenarios of discrimination in targeted advertising as a moderate or severe problem. The severity of the problem, however, depended primarily on how the discrimination occurred--based on explicit targeting of demographic factors or behavioral inferencing--and who was discriminated against. Respondents tended to rate scenarios in which differences in behavioral patterns led to discriminatory effects as less problematic and more ethical than scenarios in which discrimination was explicitly based on demographics. To our surprise, however, whether a human or an algorithm made the targeting decision had no statistically significant impact on perceptions of problem severity or ethics. Responses on severity also did not appear to differ based on the entity responsible for the discrimination (e.g., the ad network or the advertiser), and many participants held both entities responsible, regardless of which was explicitly named as the perpetrator. Based on these results, we suggest implications for companies and policymakers and suggest future work to deepen understanding of attitudes toward discrimination in targeted advertising.\n', 'The participant then answered Likert-scale questions about how responsible various entities (e.g., the advertiser, the ad network) were for the discrimination, whether each entity had acted ethically, and whether the overall situ-\n', ""All three studies were approved by the University of Maryland's Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n"", 'Table 7: Factors used in the regression models for problem, responsibility, ethics, and believability.

T- indicates the race of the targeted group, while R/E indicates the race or ethnicity of the respondent.\n', '5.3.5 Ethical Behavior\n', ""Next, we consider respondents' opinions about whether each of the four entities behaved ethically. Specifically, respondents were asked to agree or disagree that the entity had behaved ethically, on a five-point Likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Across all scenarios, 75% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the user behaved ethically (median = agree, or 2). Additionally, 57% of respondents reported that the local news network behaved ethically (median = agree). On the other hand, only 49% and 43% agreed or strongly agreed that the advertiser and ad network, respectively, behaved ethically (both medians = neutral (3)). We note that these ratings align well with those observed for responsibility.\n"", 'The regression results for ethical behavior are shown in Tables 15-18. Consistent with the findings from previous\n', 'Figure 6: Agreement that each entity was behaving ethically, broken down by the behavioral and demographic conditions.\n', 'questions, the mechanism of targeting is significant for advertiser, ad network and local news website; in all three cases, behavior-based targeting is significantly correlated with a lower perception of unethical behavior than the demographic-based targeting. This is illustrated in Figure 6. Human vs. algorithmic decision making continues to show no significant effect.\n', ""In contrast to responsibility, the entity making the decision in the provided scenario (the ad network or advertiser) does not appear to have a significant effect on respondents' perceptions of ethical behavior in any case. The targeted group is similarly uncorrelated.\n"", 'Respondent demographics appear to have little to no correlation with these results. In two cases (ad network and local news site), Asian respondents were more likely to disagree that the entity in question had behaved ethically, but no other demographic covariates were significant.\n', 'Table 15: Regression results for ethical behavior by the ad network (n=891), where OR > 1 is associated with stronger disagreement that the ad network behaved ethically.

See Table 10 caption for more detailed explanation.\n', ""Overall, we find that for most questions we examined, people's perceptions of discriminatory ad-targeting scenarios depend on how the discrimination occurred. As might be expected, respondents rated scenarios in which the discrimination occurred based on how users behaved, with no explicit intent to discriminate based on demographic characteristics, to be significantly less problematic than scenarios with explicit racial targeting. Respondents also assigned more blame to the ad network, advertiser, and host website, and rated these entities' behavior as less ethical, in the behavioral scenarios.\n"", 'not influence respondents\' ratings of the severity of the scenarios, or of whether any entity had behaved ethically. Overall, the median ethics rating for both the ad network and the advertiser was neutral. We suspect this may relate part to many respondents not entirely understanding some subtleties of the online ad ecosystem. Nevertheless, these results suggest that it is not necessarily helpful for entities to ""pass the blame"" to other players, as the mechanism of discrimination seems more important. We were also surprised to find that whether a person or an algorithm was responsible for selecting how and whom to target made no difference in respondents\' ratings of the severity of the scenario, suggesting that ""an algorithm did it"" will not be a viable excuse.\n', 'A number of organizations, including the FTC, the EFF, and industry groups such as the American Advertising Federation, provide guidelines and recommendations for the ethical use of targeted advertising [1, 18, 25]. Of these recommendations, only the EFF policy document mentions discrimination as a potential, unethical consequence. Our results, as well as prior research that has brought to light instances of discrimination (e.g., [13, 37]), highlight the importance of discrimination as an ad-targeting consideration.

Characterizing the Nature and Dynamics of Tor Exit Blocking,2017,USENIX Security,True,True,Censorship,exempt,"[""Challenges. We grapple with two key challenges: First, measuring Tor traffic is antithetical to the goals of the anonymity system and poses ethical challenges. Second, defining and identifying undesired or abusive network traffic is hard as opinions vary and encryption can render inspection of traffic infeasible. We address both challenges by focusing on the receivers' reactions to Tor traffic rather than the traffic itself. We consider email complaints sent to Tor relay operators (§4) and blacklisting of Tor-related IP addresses (§5), and take measurements of server responses to Tor traffic, both synthetic (§6) and user-driven (§7). These datasets not only allow us to observe the effects of undesired traffic without measuring it, but also provide an operational definition of undesired traffic: the traffic that leads to complaints, blacklisting, or rejecting of Tor users. This operationalization allows us to sidestep debates over what constitutes abuse and to focus on the subset of undesired Tor traffic that has affected operators and users.\n"", 'We maintain counters for several events of interest associated with users browsing websites in the Alexa Top 1M.

A video demo is available at [6]. Evaluation methodology. We compare our UI state based camera peeking attack against the blind attack, which periodically calls open() to check the foreground camera usage as described in §7.2. We add parameter idle time for the blind attack as the camera usage checking period. The longer the idle time is, the lower the DoS possibility and the camera possession frequency are. However, the idle time cannot be so long that the attack misses the camera shooting events. Thus, the blind attack faces a trade-off between the DoS risk, the camera possession frequency, and the attack success rate. User study. We evaluate our attack with a user study of 10 volunteers. In the study we use 4 Samsung Galaxy S3 phones with Android 4.1. Three of them use the blind attacks with idle time being 3, 4 and 5 seconds respectively, and the last one uses the UI state based attack. Each user performs 10 rounds, and in each round, the users are asked to first interact with the app as usual, and then go to the check deposit Activity and take a picture of a check provided by us.

In each of these videos, the backgrounds are of moving scenes (e.g., waves on a beach, kids playing baseball, etc.) and the text in the foreground either moves across the field of view or in-place. We painstakingly labeled each of the videos by hand to obtain the ground truth. We note that while NuCaptcha provides an API for obtaining captchas, we opted not to use that service as we did not want to interfere with their service in any way. In addition, our second set of experiments examine several countermeasures against our attacks, and so for ethical reasons, we opted to perform such experiments in a controlled manner rather than with any in-the-wild experimentation. These countermeasures are also evaluated in our user study (§6).\n', ""We now report on an IRB-approved user study with 25 participants that we conducted to assess the usability of the aforementioned countermeasures. If the challenges produced by the countermeasures prove too difficult for both computers and humans to solve, then they are not viable as captcha challenges. We chose a controlled lab study because besides collecting quantitative performance data, it gave us the opportunity to collect participants' impromptu reactions and comments, and allowed us to interview participants about their experience. This type of information is invaluable in learning why certain mitigation strategies are unacceptable or difficult for users and learning which strategies are deemed most acceptable. Additionally, while web-based or Mechanical Turk studies may have allowed us to collect data from more participants, such approaches lack the richness of data available when the experimenter has the opportunity to interact with the participants one-on-one.

Table 1 lists the clients we used for dialect learning. Since we are extracting dialects by looking at the SMTP conversations only, B@bel is agnostic to the family a bot belongs to. However, for legibility purposes, Table 1 groups bots according to the most frequent label assigned by the anti-virus products deployed by VirusTotal [44]. Our dataset contained 13 legitimate MUAs and MTAs, and 91 distinct malware samples5. We picked the spambot samples to be representative of the largest active spamming botnets according to a recent report [26] (the report lists Lethic, Cutwail, Mazben, Cutwail, Tedroo, Bagle). We also picked worm samples that spread through email, such as Mydoom. In total, the malware samples we selected belonged to 11 families. The dialect learning phase resulted in a total of 60 dialects. We explain the reason for the high number of discovered dialects later in this section.\n', 'Bots (by AV labels) Waledac, Donbot, Grum, Klez Buzus, Bagle, Lethic, Cutwail, Mydoom, Mazben, Tedroo\n', 'We then wanted to understand the reason for the high number of dialects we discovered. To this end, we considered clusters of malware samples that were talking the same dialect. For each cluster, we assigned a label to it, based on the most common anti-virus label among the samples in the cluster. All the clusters were unique, with the exception of eleven clusters marked as Lethic and two clusters marked as Mydoom. By manual inspection, we found that Lethic randomly closes the connection after sending the EHLO message. Since our dialect state machines are nondeterministic, our approach handles this case, in principle. However, in some cases, this nondeterministic behavior made it impossible to record a reply for a particular test case during our active probing. We found that each cluster labeled as Lethic differs for at most five non-recorded test cases with every other Lethic cluster. This gives us confidence to say that the dialect spoken by Lethic is indeed unique. For the two clusters labeled as Mydoom, we believe this is a common label assigned to unknown worms. In fact, the two dialects spoken by the samples in the clusters are very different. This is another indicator that B@bel can be used to classify spamming malware in a more precise fashion than is possible by relying on anti-virus labels only.\n', 'To investigate the effects of wrong server feedback to bots, we set up the following experiment. We ran 32 malware samples from four large spamming botnet families (Cutwail, Lethic, Grum, and Bagle) in a controlled environment, and redirected all of their SMTP activity to the third mail server in the B@bel architecture.

Other botnets, such as Lethic, add a random word at the end of each subject. These tricks make it harder to group emails belonging to the same campaign that are sent by different bots, because different bots will add distinct text to each message. To handle this problem, we developed a set of custom rules for the largest spamming botnets that remove the spurious content from the subject lines.\n', 'For this study, we analyzed the five different bot families that were the most active during the time of our experiments: Rustock [5], Lethic, MegaD [4, 6], Cutwail [35], and Waledac.

Interestingly, Lethic, with 887,852 IP addresses, was the largest botnet we found. This result is in contrast with the common belief in the security community that, at the time of our experiment, Rustock was the largest botnet [18]. However, from our observation, Rustock bots appeared to be more aggressive in spamming than the Lethic bots. In fact, each Rustock bot appeared, on average, 173 times per day on our DNSBL mirror logs, whereas each Lethic bot showed up only 101 times.\n', 'Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the growth of IP addresses over time for the magnification sets belonging to Lethic and Rustock (note that we experienced a downtime of the system during November 2010). The figures show that dynamic IP addresses steadily grow over time, while static IP addresses reach saturation after some time. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that we did not observe much Rustock activity between December 24, 2010 and January 10, 2011. Several sources reported that the botnet was (almost) down during this period [14, 37].

To demonstrate that the value of k (and subsequently of N ) estimated by the function produces good results for campaigns carried out by other botnets, we ran the same precision versus recall technique we used in Section 4 on other datasets. Specifically, we analyzed 600 campaigns observed in the wild, that had been carried out by the other botnets we studied (Lethic, Rustock, Waledac, and MegaD). Since we did not have access to full ground truth for these campaigns, we used the IP addresses from the seed pools as true positives, and the set of IP addresses not blacklisted by Spamhaus as false positives.

However, long-range communications channels also offer an obvious target for potential attackers, which we explore here. In this section, we describe how these channels operate, how they were reverse engineered and demonstrate that a combination of software flaws conspire to allow a completely remote compromise via the cellular voice channel. We focus on adversarial actions that leverage the existing cellular infrastructure, not ones that involve the use of adversarially-controlled infrastructure; e.g., we do not consider man-in-the-middle attacks. Telematics connectivity. For wide-area connectivity, our telematics unit is equipped with a cell phone interface (supporting voice, SMS and 3G data). While the unit uses its 3G data channel for a variety of Internet-based functions (e.g., navigation and location-based services), it relies on the voice channel for critical telematics functions (e.g., crash notification) because this medium can provide connectivity over the widest possible service area (i.e., including areas where 3G service is not yet available). To synthesize a digital channel in this environment, the manufacturer uses Airbiquity's aqLink software modem to covert between analog waveforms and digital bits. This use of the voice channel in general, and the aqLink software in particular, is common to virtually all popular North American telematics offerings today.\n"", 'In our vehicle, Airbiquity\'s software is used to create a reliable data connection between the car\'s telematics unit and a remote Telematics Call Center (TCC) operated by the manufacturer. In particular, the telematics unit incorporates the aqLink code in its Gateway program which controls both voice and data cellular communication. Since a single cellular channel is used for both voice and data, a simple, in-band, tone-based signaling protocol is used to switch the call into data mode. The in-cabin audio is muted when data is transmitted, although a tell-tale light and audio announcement is used to indicate that a call is in progress. For pure data calls (e.g., telemetry and remote diagnostics), the unit employs a so-called ""stealth"" mode which does not provide any indication that a call is in progress.

Fighting Coercion Attacks in Key Generation using Skin Conductance,2010,USENIX Security,True,True,Using Humans,approved,"['We presented our design in generating a cryptographic key using voice and skin conductance in Section 4. It is important to test it out with real human beings to evaluate its performance. However, this is difficult as we need to find a way to make the participants feel stressed or nervous. It is clear that we cannot actually coerce them to do something by, e.g., putting a gun over their heads. Nevertheless, we performed case studies to induce stress on the participants and measure their voice and skin conductance. (IRB approval was obtained from our university before the user study.) We present the experimental setup in this section and the evaluation results and discussion in the next section.\n', '· User study: watching a horror movie and being forced to plead guilty (having damaged a notebook computer). We tried our best to approximate the real-life scenarios, but there is a limit we could go when doing this to real human beings (e.g., IRB restriction).

Re CAPTCHAs—Understanding CAPTCHA Solving Services in an Economic Context,2010,USENIX Security,True,True,Using Humans,none,"['Since CAPTCHAs are only intended to obstruct automated solvers, their design point can be entirely sidestepped by outsourcing the task to human labor pools, either opportunistically or on a ""for hire"" basis. In this section, we review the evolution of this labor market, its basic economics and some of the underlying ethical issues that informed our subsequent measurement study.\n', 'The remainder of our paper focuses on active measurement of such services, both by paying for solutions and by participating in the role of a CAPTCHA-solving laborer. The security community has become increasingly aware of the need to consider the legal and ethical context of its actions, particularly for such active involvement, and we briefly consider each in turn for this project.\n', 'Aside from potential legal restrictions, there are also related ethical concerns; one can do harm without such\n', 'On the purchasing side, we impart no direct impact since we do not actually use the solutions on their respective sites. We do have an indirect impact however since, through purchasing services, we are providing support to both workers and service providers. In weighing this risk, we concluded that the indirect harm of our relatively small investment was outweighed by the benefits that come from better understanding the nature of the threat. On the solving side, the ethical questions are murkier since we understand that solutions to such CAPTCHAs will be used to circumvent the sites they are associated with. To sidestep this concern, we chose not to solve these CAPTCHAs ourselves. Instead, for each CAPTCHA one of our worker agents was asked to solve, we proxied the image back into the same service via the associated retail interface. Since each CAPTCHA is then solved by the same set of solvers who would have solved it anyway, we argue that our activities do not impact the gross outcome. This approach does cause slightly more money to be injected into the system, but this amount is small.\n']",[],[],[],[],https://www.usenix.org//conference/usenixsecurity10/re-captchas%E2%80%94understanding-captcha-solving-services-economic-context

A typical top-tier security conference has two to four reviewing cycles, and authors can submit their research papers to any of those reviewing cycles (A,B in Figure 1). Once the submission deadline has passed, initial filtering is done to check if submitted papers comply with conference submission guidelines and if there is any violation of the call for papers. All the conference submissions should meet the submission policies mentioned on the conference website, such as paper formatting, conflict of interest, anonymous submissions, ethical considerations, and concurrent submissions. Also, papers that fail to show a clear application in security or privacy are considered out of scope and not a good fit for the conference. Remaining papers are then assigned to PC members by the Program Chairs using a specific mechanism where they match the paper with an expert PC member in that area, mainly by reading the abstracts and introductions of the submitted papers (C in Figure 1). Program Chairs try their best to match the submitted papers' area with the expertise of the program committee, which in turn helps reviewers provide detailed feedback on the technical aspects of the paper. PC members may also be interested in reviewing certain papers and, therefore, bid on them (D in Figure 1).

The other 4 members are academic researchers actively contributing to the Linux community and frequently invited to give talks at the Linux Security Submit or other Linux-related conferences. In our evaluation, we asked this professional team to collect the fuzzing results (i.e., reports) from all VMs, group the reports based on their title uniqueness, and eventually preserve only the kernel reports truly tied to the 60 bugs of our selection. Note that a kernel fuzzer might trigger other kernel bugs and thus demonstrate errors. Since there have not yet been highly accurate crash triaging tools, the professional team inspects each of the kernel errors manually and preserves only the errors associated with our selected bugs. The procedure of manually triaging the kernel errors is described in Appendix B.\n', 'With the multiple manifested behaviors in hand, we expect some newly exposed error behaviors to indicate a higher exploitation potential for a kernel bug (e.g., finding an outof-bound write error behavior for a kernel bug that originally manifests less-likely-to-exploit error behavior - null pointer dereference). As a result, we further evaluate GREBE\'s capability in exploitation potential exploration. To do this, we first recruited 20+ security researchers and conducted a user study (detailed in Appendix A) under the approved IRB (STUDY00008566). From the user-study results, we obtain the relationship between a manifested error behavior and the exploitation potential. As is depicted in Table IV, each error behavior is categorized into either ""likely to exploit"" or ""less likely to exploit"". Using this error-behavior-to-exploitability mapping obtained from security researchers, we then compare our newly identified error behaviors with those specified in their original bug reports.\n', ""To find the relationship between a kernel bug's error behavior and its exploitation potential, we designed a survey (i.e. Figure 3) and conducted a user study with IRB approval. In our survey, we first asked the subjects' backgrounds, including their occupations and expertise levels. Following the background inquiry, we investigated whether the participants agree that, in most scenarios, the kernel error behaviors like double free, use-after-free, and out-of-bound access imply higher exploitation potential than the kernel error behaviors such as BUG, GPF, WARN, and NULL pointer dereference. We drew comparison between different error behaviors in the survey and provided examples to help the participants understand the context. For each comparison pair, the participant is required to briefly explain the reason if he/she disagrees with our classification.\n""]","['Privacy', 'Codes', 'Linux', 'Computer bugs', 'Fuzzing', 'Behavioral sciences', 'Security']","['dynamic testing', 'Linux', 'operating system kernels', 'program debugging', 'program testing', 'security of data', 'software reliability']","['possible error', 'conventional kernel fuzzing techniques', 'kernel code coverage', 'object-driven kernel fuzzing technique', 'reported bug', 'newly demonstrated errors', 'security researchers', 'real-world Linux kernel bugs', 'manifest 2+ additional error behaviors', '26 kernel bugs', 'GREBE discovers higher exploitation potential', 'kernel vendors', 'unveiling exploitation potential', 'unveiling kernel bugs', 'possible exploitability', 'corresponding kernel bug', 'manifested error', 'exploit development effort', 'different exploitation potentials']","['OS-Security', 'Vulnerability-Exploitation', 'Fuzzing']",https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.www2.lib.ku.edu/document/9833683

SoK A Framework for Unifying At Risk User Research,2022,IEEE S&P,True,,Usable Security,,"['Guide the how. The framework can also be used to help shape study designs and reporting, particularly interview or survey questions. For a population about which little is known, asking about all 10 contextual risk factors can ensure fairly comprehensive coverage of digital-safety concerns. For populations where some research exists, researchers can use the framework to explore how previously un- or understudied risk factors may (or may not) apply, or add depth on the impact of a specific, previously identified risk factor of interest. Researchers can also use the protective practices portion of the framework to explore more comprehensively how their participants currently protect themselves and why they choose their practices. We hope that using the framework to guide research and reporting can enable better comparisons among studies, helping to uncover when disparate populations have overlapping (or distinctive) digital-safety practices and needs. Beyond this, it is important for researchers to carefully plan ethical methods when working with at-risk users, guidance for which is an emerging area of research [23, 58].\n', 'Consider at-risk users at scale. Our framework does not replace direct engagement with at-risk users, and we advocate for such engagement when appropriate. However, doing so selectively and ethically is important, and there are still open questions about ethical methods for at-risk user research (e.g., how do researchers not overtax already stressed and resourceconstrained groups?). Meanwhile, many papers in our dataset recommended considering the impact of a technology design on the at-risk population they studied, which is incredibly important but difficult to scale across populations without a guiding framework. Our framework simplifies the challenging\n', '\x0cbut important process of thinking through potential risks and needs of multiple at-risk populations together. It does this by providing 10 contextual risk factors that organize patterns of risks and needs, and a set of protective practices at-risk users currently deploy to (sometimes ineffectively) cope. Using our framework can help researchers and technology creators prepare for user research, at interim points during multi-phased technology creation projects, or when user research across multiple at-risk populations is not an ethical option.\n', '[14] Clara Berridge, Jodi Halpern, and Karen Levy.

Exposed Infrastructures Discovery Attacks and Remediation of Insecure ICS Remote Management Devices,2022,IEEE S&P,True,,Measurement Studies II and IoT Security,,"['The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly explain the functionalities of remote management devices and use cases, then in Section 3, we propose a method to scan the devices and show 890 remote management devices are accessible from the Internet. Then, we perform penetration tests against 3 devices and identify 13 zero-day vulnerabilities in Section 4. Next, we observe the attacks against the devices using a honeypot in Section 5. To remediate the vulnerable devices, we conduct notification activities to the device operators in Section 6. We discuss ethics and related work in Sections 7 and 8, respectively. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 9.\n', 'device because of ethical reasons. We did not want to engage with actual ICS devices and risk potential disruptions. However, during the notifications and interviews (Section VI), we confirmed that at least a portion of the remote management devices were in fact connected to ICS, such as water gates. Specifically, we visited five facilities (three water treatment facilities, a hospital, and a solar power plant) for field surveys. In all five cases, we confirmed that the remote management devices are connected to the infrastructure.\n', 'Even when the WebUI is protected by an authentication mechanism, this could consist of factory-default passwords or weak passwords. For ethical reasons, we did not test which fraction of the 39% of devices with authentication enabled was suffering from this problem, but we did conduct interviews with the operators of these devices during the notification stage of our study (Section VI). During those interviews, 34% of operators admitted that they used either a default or an easyto-guess password.\n', 'Profiling visitors: Accesses using CLI like Telnet could provide richer attacker profiles, such as their technical skills, terminal settings, and decision making behaviors. For WebUI, we deployed a tracking mechanism using JavaScript-based browser fingerprinting and a cookie to associate longitudinal accesses from the same actors.

Specifically, one of the honeypot\'s IP addresses, which imitates a remote management device to monitor building facilities of an air control tower, was disclosed in a personal blog of a security researcher on January 9th, 2019. At that time, we did not observe an increase in visitors. On December 8th, 2019, our honeypot was also disclosed at a hacker forum by two posts that were submitted by the same person. We have observed burst accesses to the honeypot after the posts (Figure 7). Moreover a reply to the post said ""Open industrial command panel is always cool."" From these observations, hackers are expected to be interested in the WebUI of remote management devices. In addition to the burst accesses, we received notifications about the exposed WebUI of our honeypot from ethical visitors. We discuss these notifications in AppendixA3.\n', 'During and after the notification period, we conducted follow-up scans against the devices.

Particularly, we have carefully considered possible harms that might be done by our honeypot in line with prior studies [27,,36]. Specifically, to avoid using the honeypot for attacks, we blocked outbound traffic from the honeypot to the Internet.

The Ad Library API is insufficient for this purpose: it only returns ads once they are known to be political, which crucially excludes the period before Facebook enforces upon an ad, and omits ads that Facebook never enforces upon altogether. We therefore develop a novel large-scale data collection pipeline using the Ad Library web portal, which lists all active ads for a given page, regardless of whether they are political.

Rapid Prototyping for Microarchitectural Attacks,2022,USENIX Security,True,,Hardware Security,,"[""User Study. We conducted a double-blind within-subjects user study in which we evaluated cache attack libraries as part of an introductory graduate course on side-channel security. We tested Mastik [137] and cacheutils [13] together with libsc, an early prototype of libtea. Over 6 weeks, 19 pairs of students implemented a cache covert channel, a cache template attack on keystrokes [41], and a KASLR break (via prefetch timing [38], or Data Bounce [14]). Each pair tested one library per task in a randomized order. We focused on evaluating the usability of these tools and their attack building blocks (RQ3). 28/38 students chose to participate in our survey. We provide demographic statistics in [28]. While our institution has no ethical review board, we carefully designed the study to address ethical concerns appropriately: the survey was opt-in and entirely independent from grading, and all study responses were collected anonymously. The libraries were anonymized for the students, with the library name replaced in the code and documentation (e.g., with `library1') and other identifying information removed. None of the participating students had an academic relationship to our frameworks or the other libraries. To avoid bias, the authors did not teach the lab sessions, and conducted initial analysis of the results with the anonymized library names remapped by the course practitioners before finally analyzing student comments that deanonymized the frameworks, e.g., comments mentioning functionality specific to one framework.\n"", ""Ethical Considerations. In line with the ethical guidelines of Google's SafeSide project [33], our frameworks' aim is to facilitate attack prototyping only under controlled research conditions (e.g., in a modified browser). End-to-end attacks can indeed be created from prototypes by replacing each framework building block with an unprivileged/vanilla alternative. Crucially, however, this requires manual effort and often creation of novel attack techniques, as we demonstrate in Section 5.3. This is an important difference from, for example, penetration testing frameworks such as Metasploit [91], and means that our frameworks do not enable automated creation of end-to-end exploits that could be weaponized.\n""]",,,,,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/easdon

Exploring the Unchartered Space of Container Registry Typosquatting,2022,USENIX Security,True,,Measurement: Network,,"[""In this paper, we systematically investigate the feasibility of launching typosquatting attacks on container registries in three scenarios: public registries, private registries, and across platforms. To form the basis, we first conduct a measurement study on two widely used public registries, Docker Hub and Quay.io, to understand the existing image naming mechanism. We discover that tens of thousands of repositories have remarkably similar FQIDs, implying that the current naming system of container registries is vulnerable to typosquatting. To demonstrate the severity of typosquatting, we further consider five types of common typosquatting and upload about 4,000 typosquatting images targeting 10 usernames in Docker Hub with the approval from the Internal Review Board (IRB) of our institution. We observe that our typosquatting images are constantly downloaded by users, and attract more than 40,000 pull counts by the end of a 210-day experiment. Meanwhile, out of 10 targeted users, only one user's typosquatting images (contributing 3,867 downloading counts) are deleted by the Docker Hub on day 105. Such an observation indicates that typosquatting attacks pose a serious threat to public registries.\n"", ""To have a better understanding of the exploitability of typosquatting threats in container registries, we conduct our experiments by intentionally uploading multiple typosquatting images to the public. Since our experiments involve human interactions, we take ethical considerations seriously. Our experiment procedure and protocols are carefully designed with the collaboration of our institution's Internal Review Board (IRB) to minimize potential risks to users and ourselves.\n"", 'First, our experiment procedure should not be considered as a live phishing attempt with the use of honeypot. Watson et al. [31] described the behavior of phishing as a technique to lure victims into revealing personal information. Han et al. [32] discussed the ethical issues of conducting research with phishing honeypots. Szurdi et al. [20] studied email typosquatting by registering typosquatting domains as honeypots to collect mis-delivered emails. They examined the content of the received emails to check if any sensitive information is included in these emails. Moreover, they sent ""honey emails"" to existing typosquatting domains to scrutinize the responses. Our experiment protocol differs from such a procedure: we do not have access to any information about the users who download our images, nor do we attempt to collect any data from within our typosquatting images. We only gather information about the pull counts of our uploaded images. Such download statistics are available on the Docker Hub as public information and the Google Cloud Console in the category of registry API usage. Therefore, ethical considerations of protecting sensitive information collection and storage are not needed in our experiments.\n', 'With the IRB approval, we conduct a 60-day experiment targeting the official container images provided by Google. We randomly select 10 images and generate 100 DL-1 usernames with typosquatting categories, including AD, DE, SW, MI, and FF. We use the same Ubuntu image mentioned in Section 4 for the typosquatting image. We record 62 pull counts for our uploaded images, with the highest download count of 14. We further conduct a control group experiment in which we upload 50 typosquatting images with DL-3 usernames and 50 images with randomly generated FQIDs. At the end of our 60-day experiment, we record 6 downloads for these 100 images.\n', 'To further illustrate the effectiveness of the missinghostname attack, we also perform a 30-day experiment with the IRB approval of our institution. We randomly select 10 unique usernames on Quay.io with high activity ratings, and then manually register these usernames on Docker Hub. We also upload our container images with the same name as the original image name in Quay.io.

Dos and Don ts of Machine Learning in Computer Security,2022,USENIX Security,True,,ML: Principles & Best Practices,,"[""Description. As in all empirical disciplines, it is common to perform experiments under certain assumptions to demonstrate a method's efficacy. While performing controlled experiments is a legitimate way to examine specific aspects of an approach, it should be evaluated in a realistic setting whenever possible to transparently assess its capabilities and showcase the open challenges that will foster further research. Security implications. Many learning-based systems in security are evaluated solely in laboratory settings, overstating their practical impact. A common example are detection methods evaluated only in a closed-world setting with limited diversity and no consideration of non-stationarity [15, 71]. For example, a large number of website fingerprinting attacks are evaluated only in closed-world settings spanning a limited time period [72]. Similarly, several learning-based malware detection systems have been insufficiently examined under realistic settings [see 5, 104]. Recommendations. It is essential to move away from a laboratory setting and approximate a real-world setting as accurately as possible. For example, temporal and spatial relations of the data should be considered to account for the typical dynamics encountered in the wild [see 104]. Similarly, runtime and storage constraints should be analyzed under practical conditions [see 15, 112, 130]. Ideally, the proposed system should be deployed to uncover problems that are not observable in a lab-only environment, such as the diversity of real-world network traffic [see 119]--although this is not always possible due to ethical and privacy constraints.\n"", 'The preceding identification and analysis of common pitfalls in the security literature has been carried out with utmost care. However, there are some limitations that are naturally inherent to this kind of work. Even though these do not affect the overall conclusion of our analysis, we discuss them in the following for the sake of completeness. Pitfalls. Although some pitfalls may seem obvious at first, our prevalence analysis indicates the opposite. This lack of awareness obstructs progress, and it will persist until addressed by the community. Furthermore, we cannot cover all ten pitfalls in detail, as our focus is on a comprehensive overview. Finally, some pitfalls cannot always be prevented, such as sampling bias, label inaccuracy, or lab-only settings. For example, it is likely not possible to test an attack in a real environment due to ethical considerations. In such cases, simulation is the only option. As outlined in §2, corrective measures may even be an open problem, yet awareness of pitfalls is a first step towards amending experimental practices and ultimately devising novel methods for mitigating them. Prevalence analysis. For the prevalence analysis, we skimmed all papers of top security conferences in the last 10 years and identified 30 papers that use machine learning prominently (e.g., mentioned in the abstract or introduction). Even though this selection process is not entirely free from bias, the identified pitfalls are typical for this research branch and the respective papers are often highly cited.\n', 'Data collection and ethics. Our institution does not require a formal IRB process for the survey conducted in this work. However, we contacted the ethical review board of our institution and achieved approval from its chair for conducting the survey. Moreover, we designed the survey in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU, minimizing and anonymizing data where possible.

SAID State aware Defense Against Injection Attacks on In vehicle Network,2022,USENIX Security,True,,Smart Vehicles,,"['We implement a prototype of SAID on an iMx.6 board extended with sensors and two OBD-II ports, running an Android operating system, and the backend services run on the server, through which the users can update the defense rules. For the evaluation, we also implement a customized OBD-II dongle to collect CAN messages from real vehicles and inject CAN messages. As shown in Fig. 6, besides simulating various driving scenarios, we design experiments on the real vehicles, robotic cars, and testbed to evaluate SAID. Simulation: To evaluate our dynamics-based state estimation and attack defense approaches, we use the professional vehicle simulator CarSim [63] to simulate various abnormal vehicle motions, including rollover, under/oversteer, and accelerating/braking, which are caused by injecting the messages related to throttle, steering wheel, and brake pedal, due to the ethics and safety considerations. We also evaluate the impacts of the model configurations (i.e., thresholds) on the performance of anomaly detection. More defense evaluations are presented in Appendix-A.1. Robotic Cars: We also use three robotic cars (i.e., NanoCar, JetRacer Pro, and Scout Mini) to evaluate the performance of dynamics-based defense. It is worth noting that the scaleddown robotic cars have various differences from the real passenger vehicles, for example, these robotic cars have no brake, as well as smaller sizes and motion ranges. Consequently, they are more prone to environmental disturbance than a real passenger car. During the evaluation, we add extra loads to the robotic cars to make them more like real cars. Real Vehicles: We conduct evaluations on seven real vehicles in total. First, we collect over 600 km real road IVN and diagnostic traffic from two real cars, a Skoda Octavia and a Volkswagen Lavida, driven by three drivers with video recording. The real-vehicle traffic is replayed on the testbed for evaluations in §6.2.2 and §6.3. We also evaluate SAID by launching functional service layer attacks on five additional cars, including Audi A4, BMW 523LI, Toyota Corolla HV, Nissan Teana, and Volkswagen Passat, and more details are presented in §6.2.2. Testbed: We design and implement a vehicle testbed, named VCar, for evaluating SAID. It can replay the real-vehicle traffic and meanwhile play the recorded video in real-time. The topology of our testbed is shown in Fig. 6, where the vehicle is emulated by VCar and the PoC (proof-of-concept) attacks\n']",,,,,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/xue-lei

Care ethics emphasize the value and necessity of caring labour as well as the values of empathy, sensitivity, trust, and responding to need.\n', 'This study received ethical approval from the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee.

Many Roads Lead To Rome How Packet Headers Influence DNS Censorship Measurement,2022,USENIX Security,True,,Network Security: Scanning & Censorship,,"['We begin by discussing the ethical guidelines and principles we adhered to when developing our methodology and conducting our study. We then explore the design considerations for (1) choosing the destination IPs we perform the experiments on, and (2) choosing the input parameters of the packets we vary. Finally, we describe how given a set of destination IPs and source parameters, we identify routing and censorship changes, and use methodology to develop understanding of how changes in the source parameters influences paths differences and observed censorship behavior.\n', 'A key insight is since BreadCrumb is interested in changes in censorship based on packet construction, rather than the actual censorship result itself, the challenging [31] problem of detecting if the IP address in a response is correct, is simplified. We further solve this problem by focusing our measurements on symmetric DNS censorship, meaning censorship apparatuses that inject responses on both inbound and outbound (from the perspective of the censor) DNS packets. As discussed subsequently, focusing on symmetric censorship aids the scale of our measurements, supports the ethical principles we adhere to (Section 3.2), and simplifies understanding response packets.\n', 'We utilize Chinese DNS censorship as a lens for understanding the phenomena of routing-induced censorship changes. We selected China for two reasons: (1) DNS censorship in China is well studied [19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 37, 42], and (2) Chinese DNS censorship is symmetric [23, 31]. This symmetry allows us to develop measurement methodologies that adhere to our ethical guidelines while still replicating the methodologies of previous studies [31, 36, 37].\n', 'By leveraging this symmetric behavior and the need to only capture changes in censorship, we can measure DNS censorship by probing any IP address in a given network range-- we do not need to limit our measurements to actual DNS resolvers, as the censors will inject responses for packets destined for any address. To that end we focus our measurements on IP addresses that do not have any open ports observable via Censys [16]. Selecting such IPs allows any response observed to be a censorship response (since the destination IP does not respond), and ensures that no subsequent queries are generated by the measured IP addresses. This allows us extensive flexibility in our measurements while also helping to address ethical concerns (Section 3.2).\n', 'Our measurement methodology is designed around considering issues of ethics. Measuring Internet censorship carries potential risks. We consider these risks across two axes: (1) if issuing DNS queries for censored domain names via resolvers we do not control could potentially implicate unrelated parties, and (2) if issuing our queries could create load on DNS servers we do not control. We begin to address these issues by limiting our censorship measurement to IP addresses that have no observable open common ports. More specifically we send DNS packets to a closed port that will not respond to us. We also limit our measurements to the minimal volume of IP addresses and domain names we need to ensure our results are representative; our goal is not exhaustive exploration but rather demonstrating the existence of a phenomena in order to improve future studies. Despite these steps to mitigate risk it may still exist. We therefore consider the ethics of performing our experiments based on the structure established by prior studies [30,31], namely considering the ethical guidelines and principles from the Belmont [7] and Menlo [15] reports.\n', 'The benefit of selecting a ""non responsive"" IP in the same subnet as a vantage point is twofold. First, this method keeps with our ethical principles (Section 3.2) by limiting risk as much as possible--our queries elicit no responses from the destination IP, and the destination IPs do not in turn issue subsequent queries. Second, any DNS responses we receive should be the result of censorship, thus simplifying analysis. From this list of viable candidate destination addresses we randomly sample weighting by the autonomous system in an effort to obtain network diversity. The number of IPs selected varies and is kept as low as possible based on the experiment. This is discussed further in Section 4.\n', 'BreadCrumb performs DNS Traceroute only for experiments aimed at understanding paths. For experiments aimed at understanding changes in censorship, BreadCrumb forgoes all traceroute and TTL measurements to limit the overall number of packets sent, in keeping with our ethical guidelines.\n', 'Our exploration of packet construction driven censorship changes spans three distinct and iterative experiments: (1) router path exploration, (2) assessing the scope of changes across IPs, and (3) assessing the scope of changes across domain names. In this section we explain the data collected for each experiment and how we processed the data to obtain our results. In keeping with our ethical principles, we limit the scale of each experiment to what we believe are the minimal viable set of domains and/or IP addresses to successfully evaluate our research questions. Table 1 provides an overview of input parameters used for all experiments.\n', 'We began by identifying a set of vantage points inside China using the Censys dataset as described in Section 3.3.1. Using an August 2021 snapshot we began with 13.6 million IPs that were geolocated within China. Of those we identified 175K that were open on port 53 (i.e., open resolvers). From these we used our ""inactive"" methodology to select 175K IPs in the same subnet which had no known open ports. We selected IPs near these open resolvers in an effort to provide results consistent with open resolver measurement studies [31, 36], while still adhering to our ethical guidelines. These 175K IPs were spread across 363 autonomous systems (ASes). We verified before and during our experimentation that each IP address remained unresponsive on port 53. All experiments were performed across the month of September 2021.\n', 'Weighing the need for a comprehensive picture of routing and censorship changes against ethical concerns, we randomly selected a subset of IPs appropriate for each experiment, controlling for balance across ASes. For our Router Paths experiment we randomly selected 363 IPs (one per AS), and to explore Changes Across IPs we selected 10,000 IPs (randomly, but weighted by AS). For Changes Across Domains, we selected 492 destinations that exhibited the most variation in previous experiments to explore (only) domain differences.\n', 'We began with the Citizen Lab Block List (CLBL) [14] consisting of 567 sensitive domains across 27 different categories for China.

Interestingly, there is no evidence that the researchers ever realized that the implementation problems they uncovered actually come from the specification weaknesses known years before. Due to the ethical constraints on evaluating our findings on real-world carrier networks and the failure of current simulators to support many functionalities (e.g., handover, emergency), most SR-CRs cannot be verified.

SBAS successfully protects all customer-tocustomer communication from our attacks and significantly improves the resilience of communication between SBAS customers and non-participating hosts.\n', 'We used two primary methods to evaluate the security of SBAS: (1) real-world attacks using the PEERING BGP research framework [69], and (2) simulated attacks using Internet topology simulations [33]. These two methods are intended to complement each other. The PEERING framework allows us to launch ethical BGP attacks against the real SBAS prototype deployment and accurately captures the dynamics of Internet routing, but does not let us experiment with many different adversary locations (as we are limited by the nodes of the PEERING framework). Topology simulations allow us to experiment with a large number of adversary locations but yield less accurate results [41]. However, when considered side-by-side, the results of these two types of evaluations complement each other, allowing for a more accurate understanding of the security of SBAS.\n', 'Table 2: Summary of ethically conducted real-world attack experiments (via PEERING) from an adversary at neu01.\n', ""Ethical considerations. An important ethical principle underlying our experiment setup is that we only made BGP announcements for prefixes that we are authorized to use. Even though we used the neu01 mux as an adversary to model our attacks, it had proper authorization from the PEERING framework for all of its BGP announcements. Further, we used IP prefixes explicitly delegated to our infrastructure (from PEERING and participating educational institutions) that hosted no production services and served no real users. Finally, we also followed the PEERING framework's acceptable use policy as to not overwhelm or crash internet routers.\n"", 'To measure the impact of SBAS on communication between a SBAS customer and external hosts, we performed ethical equally-specific prefix hijacks from the adversary neu01 against IP prefixes originated by utah01 and grnet01 and announced by SBAS (using nodes at amsterdam01 and seattle01). Similarly, we also performed ethical hijacks where no SBAS was used as the control case. Then, for each hijack, we launched a ping scan of the 1k external hosts in our sample from an IP address in the prefix that was being hijacked. When each host in the sample received the ping request, it generated a ping response with a destination IP address that was under attack by the adversary. Computing the fraction of hosts whose ping responses were routed to the adversary allowed us to measure the impact of each hijack we launched.\n', 'Choice of BGP Announcement Node Locations Locations for the BGP announcement nodes for the threeto six-node SBAS configurations simulated in Section 7.2.1 were computed by simulating all possible N node combinations from the set of 15 total transit-carrying PEERING nodes against another random sample of 1000 AS attackers, and then choosing the best performing node locations within them. In general, we found that the globally optimal node location configuration was equivalent to the iterative greedily optimized one, which can serve as an efficient guiding principle for scaling up the SBAS backbone in the future (starting from the current deployment shown in Figure 12). While SBAS may leverage any AS-level participant to announce BGP routes, we restricted the simulation to sets of PEERING nodes as a parallel to deployments in the ethical hijacking experiments. We note that choosing SBAS BGP announcement nodes outside of the PEERING network may provide further security gains, which will be a focus for future work. We anticipate adding other announcement nodes in geographical areas where PEERING has no presence, such as Asia, may provide the greatest further resilience gains beyond the simulated deployments.\n']",,,,,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/birge-lee

Thus, a teacher model owner needs a way to track the parties that use their model to build student models.\n', 'Their primary goal is to directly steal the exact victim model, build a surrogate model with similar functionality, or infer other internal model information. By contrast, our proposed attack essentially focuses on exploiting the model sharing practice in transfer learning, to quickly identify the presence of pre-trained components. Once identifying the teacher model components, the attacker has stepped further to realize the aforementioned malicious or unethical goals.\n', 'Attack motivations. We first list potential motivations to conduct the teacher model fingerprinting attack. Breaking model confidentiality. Internal model setup, such as architecture or parameters, is supposed to be kept confidential for the sake of IP protection or security consideration. However, the model behind an MLaaS platform is no longer a secret once the teacher model has been identified. The attacker can effortlessly recover early layers with the publicly transparent teacher model information. Stepping stone to advanced attacks. As mentioned before, our teacher model fingerprinting attack provides a cheap way to recover most parameters inherited from the teacher model, which helps to open the ""black box."" Once opening the black box, the attacker has stepped further to discover and exploit vulnerabilities of the student model. For instance, they can easily conduct various white-box adversarial attacks against the victim model, such as adversarial example attacks [10] and membership inference attacks [24]. Also, recent studies have shown that transfer learning may transfer vulnerabilities from the teacher [48], which the attacker can directly exploit. Forensics. Despite the aforementioned malicious goals, we can also treat our teacher model fingerprinting attack as a new forensic tool for ML applications. For instance, a teacher model owner does not want their model to be transferred to perform unethical or illegal tasks, such as weapon classification. A potential IP protection solution is to embed watermarks to model [8, 25, 47]. However, we are witnessing an arms race right now, where watermarking schemes would be broken by new attacks [29]. Our fingerprinting approach can complement watermarking for IP protection. Also, in some cases, certain parties can intentionally publish a vulnerable teacher model, which will result in the corresponding student models inheriting vulnerabilities [45]. For both of these cases, our attack can be used by a third-party forensic service as a defense to track the origin of a student model. Threat model in detail. Then, we describe the detailed threat model in real-world settings.

We perform a case study in a real campus network to show that our attack can cause serious damages to NAT networks. Due to IP address space exhaustion, NAT is proposed as a standard to allow the expansion of the Internet to continue without moving to IPv6 [81]. Nowadays, NAT is ubiquitous especially at the edge of campus networks, enterprise networks, and residential networks [47]. In NAT networks, local DNS resolvers [36, 54] or DNS forwarders [36, 72] are fairly prevalent [40, 72, 73], since they are locally accessible to reduce network latency and avoid being exposed directly to Internet attackers [35]. In this attack, we show that an off-path attacker can hijack queries from a local DNS forwarder and then poison the local DNS cache of the NAT network. As a result, the off-path attacker can manipulate DNS requests of all users under the same network stealthily. We implement this attack in our real campus network and show its seriousness ethically. Experimental Setup. 5 types of devices are involved in this attack. 1) A HUAWEI NAT gateway bundling 120 clients\n', 'After the local DNS cache is poisoned, all users in the NAT network will be affected, i.e., the off-path attacker can manipulate the user\'s network requests arbitrarily. Figure 12 shows that the request of a user (a client host under our control due to ethical considerations) to the website of ""www.yahoo.com"" is hijacked to a fake one as a result of the bogus IP address of the domain name that the user received from the poisoned DNS forwarder.

We conducted all experiments inside private workspaces with the authors as the only members. We did not exercise cross-workspace features; thus, our investigations did not influence other workspaces. We did not distribute or submit our test malicious apps to any BCP app directory, so our attack did not affect BCP users other than the authors' testing accounts. We ethically disclosed all attacks we found to Slack and Microsoft, both of which have confirmed their existence. Due to their view of the workspace as a trusted environment, the assumptions that social engineering is a prerequisite for the attacks, and that the workspace administrator will correctly manage app installations, these attacks do not meet their definitions of a security vulnerability.\n"", ""For ethical reasons, we did not publish our attack apps to the Slack app directory or Microsoft Teams app store, and thus cannot comment on their vetting processes. However, we did analyze their security guidelines [12, 16] for publishing apps and found no obvious restrictions that would fundamentally prevent the attacks described in this paper. These attacks rely on abusing permissions acquired for benign purposes, causing the information-limited vetting to be ineffective. BCPs do, however, prohibit two apps from sharing the same name, making it harder for a published app to mimic the appearance of another app; but as we noted in Section 5, a Slack app can circumvent this restriction by requesting the chat: write.customize permission scope, which allows the app the send messages using customized name and icon, avoiding the need to modify the app's own name and icon declared in the manifest.\n""]",,,,,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/chen-yunang-experimental
Watching the watchers bias and vulnerability in remote proctoring software,2022,USENIX Security,True,,Measurement: Auditing & Best Practices,,"['While our survey involved contacting law schools and state bar associations to determine what platforms they use and how they use them, our work was exempt from IRB review as we did not collect data pertaining to individuals.\n', 'Our analysis of facial recognition systems used a data set containing images of incarcerated individuals who were not given an opportunity by the original researcher to consent to its use for research. We consulted with an applied ethicist independent of the project and determined that while we are unable to rectify the consent issue to fully uphold the principle of autonomy, use of these images is nonetheless appropriate, as our work fulfills the principle of beneficence in the following manner:\n', 'We intentionally refrain from evaluating server side components and functionality of the software packages to avoid the accompanying legal and ethical concerns. We conducted responsible disclosure to the proctoring suite vendors, making them aware of discovered vulnerabilities along with potential remediation steps. We believe this mitigates any potential harm disclosing these vulnerabilities may have on exam integrity.\n', 'As a highly regulated industry, law pays particular attention to ethical and professional standards. When a law student cheats within school or during a licensing exam, there is a high likelihood that the accrediting organization will prohibit them (potentially permanently) from practice. We infer that these high standards within the profession affect decisions made regarding exam administration and the choice of what remote proctoring software platform to use, if any.\n', '\x0citation on what the Examplify software may do. Other privacy policies contain conflicting statements about the software\'s activities. For example, the Extegrity Exam4 privacy policy states, ""Exam4 does not access any data on the laptop other than the data created by the act of taking an exam"" and ""Exam4 monitors activity the student engages in while taking an exam and creates an encrypted log report for evidentiary purposes."" It is not possible for Exam4 to monitor activity the student engages in if it does not access any data other than that created by the act of taking an exam. These types of statements thwart a student\'s ability to meaningfully consent. Furthermore, even if an examinee was fully aware of the software privacy implications, meaningful consent is still lacking given the examinee\'s lack of meaningful alternatives. Faced with accepting and using the software as-is or refraining from taking the exam, most law students would opt for the former, as the latter coincides with an inability to become a licensed lawyer. Such a choice is not a choice. These policies and agreements fail to meet conventional ethical standards for consent [3].\n', 'We thank Paul Ohm (Georgetown) and the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School staff for their assistance; Simon Coghlan for consultation on the ethics of our dataset usage; and Jelena Mirkovic for the thoughtful feedback.\n']",,,,,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/burgess

How Are Your Zombie Accounts Understanding Users Practices and Expectations on Mobile App Account Deletion,2022,USENIX Security,True,,User Studies: Sharing,,"[""Our study addressed the three research questions as follows. First, to understand the necessity of account deletion and users' awareness of utilizing account deletion to protect personal data (RQ1), we investigated how users dealt with the app accounts that they no longer used. To identify current users' practices and understandings of account deletion (RQ2), we asked participants about their own experience of account deletion, the potential reasons behind these behaviors, and what their cognition of account deletion was. To assess users' feelings and expectations of account deletion (RQ3), we asked participants how they felt during the account deletion process and what their expectations were in the online survey. It may have been a long time since the participants last deleted an account, and their memories of the account deletion process may be blurred. So we supplemented an independent offline semi-structured interview to better collect users' feelings and expectations. The designs of our online survey and the on-site interview are guided by our model proposed in the pre-study (Section 4).

Gossamer Securely Measuring Password based Logins,2022,USENIX Security,True,,Passwords,,"[""To showcase the utility of Gossamer, we worked in close collaboration with two large universities' information technology (IT) security departments to perform a measurement study of login behavior. Our measurement study protocols, including Gossamer's design and implementation, went through a thorough, multi-step review process that included reviews by the security engineering teams from both universities, representatives of each university's administration, and the relevant IRBs. This process culminated in a determination that Gossamer poses minimal risk. We deployed Gossamer for seven months at University 1 (U1) and for three months at University 2 (U2). We observed 34 million login requests (combined) for approximately 500 K users who regularly log in to access various university-provided critical online services such as email, course enrollment, and employment information.\n"", 'We partnered with security engineers at two large universities to deploy Gossamer and collect data, beginning in December 2020. We collected data for seven months at U1 and three months at U2 (a shorter timeframe due to the preferences of the IT department) . This timeframe encompassed midsemester, exam, and break periods, so we were able to observe different levels of activities. Throughout this timeframe, we occasionally made updates to some of the measurement mechanisms; these updates were done after careful review of the code by pulling from a git repository accessible to the virtual machine running the measurement service, and any summary statistic that may be affected an update was calculated using the data after the update was made . Review process and ethical considerations. Although our research could help understand characteristics of password submissions received by login systems, we must also consider the privacy and security risks of inadvertent exposure of the sensitive information in the logs. Our design of Gossamer, therefore, strives to balance these risks with the benefits of protecting user accounts. We conducted a nearly year-long design and implementation effort that entailed a number of external review processes to help guide our research study and reduce potential privacy and security risks to users.\n', ""Before deploying the system, we submitted our study designs for IRB review at each university. The study protocols at the two universities were slightly different in how we report to IT security compromised user accounts. At U1, researchers never had access to plaintext usernames, and the security engineers handled the decryption of reported (encrypted) usernames. Therefore, we received an IRB exemption at U1, which found that the research study does not qualify as human subjects research. At U2, security engineers requested that we report the plaintext usernames for operational simplicity. One researcher decrypts the username before reporting compromises. Therefore, we received IRB approval at U2, finding the study as a minimal risk human subject research. We did not seek consent from individual users, as we do not know their usernames or email addresses. Instead we obtained explicit approval for conducting this study from the universities' leadership and IT departments who provide the login services. Such waivers of explicit consent from participants were used in prior work (e.g., [21]) and are discussed as an acceptable approach in the Menlo report [23]. Deployment configuration. As mentioned in Section 3, Gossamer consists of two services -- a measurement service and an analysis service. For U1, we used Amazon EC2 in a virtual private network to host the measurement service as recommended by the U1 security engineers, and we used\n""]",,,,,https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/sanusi-bohuk
